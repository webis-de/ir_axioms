# ↕️ ir_axioms

Axiomatic constraints for information retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation.

`ir_axioms` is a Python framework for experimenting with axioms in information retrieval in a declarative way.
It includes reference implementations of many commonly used traditional retrieval axioms as well as axioms for retrieval-augmented generation.
The library is well integrated with the [PyTerrier](https://github.com/terrier-org/pyterrier) framework and supports [Pyserini](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini) retrieval indices too.
Use-cases of `ir_axioms` include search-result re-ranking, analyses of (neural) retrieval systems, and analyses of generated RAG answers.

_Note: If you're looking out for `ir_axioms`<1.0, please [go here](https://github.com/webis-de/ir_axioms/tree/legacy)._

## Installation

1. Install the package from PyPI:

   ```shell
   pip install ir_axioms>=1.0
   ```

2. Install spaCy model:

   ```shell
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

### Optional Dependencies

| Tag | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `pyserini` | Use index statistics, document contents, and tokenization from Pyserini/Anserini indices. |
| `pyterrier` | Use index statistics, document contents, and tokenization from PyTerrier/Terrier indices. Apply KwikSort re-ranking to PyTerrier pipelines. Run axiomatic analyses. |
| `keybert` | Use KeyBERT for aspect extraction (must be enabled manually). |
| `sbert` | Use Sentence Transformers for sentence similarity (enabled automatically). |

Note: To reproduce our results from ICTIR'25, please use these extras: `pyterrier,keybert,sbert`

## Usage

Run the CLI with:

```shell
ir_axioms --help
```

## Development

1. Install [Python 3.11](https://python.org/downloads/) or later.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```shell
   python3 -m venv venv/
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -e .[tests]
   ```

4. Install spaCy model:

   ```shell
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

5. After having implemented a new feature, please check the code format, inspect common LINT errors, and run all unit tests with the following commands:

   ```shell
   ruff check .                   # Code format and LINT
   mypy .                         # Static typing
   bandit -c pyproject.toml -r .  # Security
   pytest .                       # Unit tests
   ```
