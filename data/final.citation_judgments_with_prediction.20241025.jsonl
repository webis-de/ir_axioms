This shows that people born during a solar eclipse can have a positive impact on mental health awareness.  According to Doc 3, President Donald Trump was born during a lunar eclipse, which offers similar gifts, but instead of using his power to foster positive change, he wields his power as a weapon of destruction. This suggests that the way an eclipse is used can have a significant impact on mental health.  According to Doc 8, scientists have debunked any claims that solar eclipses can affect human behavior, health, or the environment, including mental health. However, it is noted that anyone watching a solar eclipse must protect their eyes.  According to Doc 9, a lunar eclipse does not have a significant effect on mental health, as it is just a natural astronomical event.  According to Doc 10, solar eclipses can be seen as a time of change and new beginnings, and can affect the world for six months after the event.

Additionally, Doc 8: The Education Trust reports that \"many are the first in their families to attempt a degree\" and that \"Latinos are more likely to opt for community colleges and for-profit colleges, where graduation rates are lower.\" This implies that many Latinos may not have had access to adequate education or resources to succeed in their educational pursuits, which could lead to misinformation or misunderstandings about education.
