Until Wuornos, the mass media almost always depicted a serial perpetrator as a deranged man, due to the erroneous and paternalistic societal notion that women could not commit such crimes. Unlike the obscure and rarely discussed Black Widow killers throughout history, Wuornos became a popular culture icon because she defied stereotypes and did not kill \"demurely,\" as societal norms dictate that a woman should [3]. \n\n- Interestingly, the most prolific serial killer in all of history may have been female\u2014Hungarian Countess Elizabeth B\u00e1thory de Ecsed, who was born on August 17, 1560.

Following her husband's death, the countess and four collaborators allegedly tortured, sexually assaulted, and killed hundreds of girls and young women. Incredibly, Elizabeth was never tried or convicted of any crimes herself [3].","probability":0.3761978178}

The low number of women committing murders may be because women generally murder for very different reasons than males [4,5,6,8,9,12,13,14,16,17,18]. Sex and pleasure, for example, are more likely to be a man's reason for murder than a woman's [4,5,6,9,14]. Men are also more prone to random killings while women are more prone to kill someone they are closely related to or involved with [6,7,8,12,13,16,17,18]. They are also more likely to kill for profit, to improve their lifestyle, or for revenge [6,8,9,12,13,16,17].\n\nAdditionally, even for more newsworthy murders, such as mass killings, women are also less likely to be the perpetrators [13]. The same is true in the case of serial killings, where only about 15 per cent are committed by females [4,9,14]. Serial killing is a rare crime and documented serial killings are rare, even more so when they are perpetrated by women [0,1,2,7,8,15].\n\nSome researchers have pointed out that while the number of reported female serial killers is negligible, the actual figure is quite likely higher [0,1,2,3,4,7,9,14,15,18]. A suggested reason for that is that females are better at planning, executing, and hiding their crimes [7,9].  \n\nSociety also tends to think women are incapable of being murderous and committing \"heinous\" crimes, such as serial and mass killings [0,1,2,3,4,8,10]. This may be why we tend to naturally think of a serial killer as being male [1,4,5,6,8,14].  Women are more thought of as nurturers and caregivers and thus it is easy to dismiss the idea of a woman being a murderer [0,3,4,5,6,8,10]. Instead, women who have been proven to be the perpetrators of \"heinous\" crimes are likely to be painted (and accepted) as victims who were manipulated by men [4].\n\nThere are female murderers but their low numbers and the reasons they kill make it rare to hear about female murderers.","probability":0.1315971274}

Society often stereotypes women as nurturing and non-violent, which leads to a biased perception that women are less likely to commit heinous crimes, such as murder [0, 3, 6, 19]. This stereotype is reflected in popular media, which tends to focus on male murderers, creating a skewed representation of violent crime [5, 14]. Furthermore, the modus operandi and motives of female murderers differ significantly from those of their male counterparts. While male serial killers are often driven by sexual motives, female perpetrators tend to kill for more pragmatic reasons, such as financial gain or revenge [6, 8].\n\nStatistically, female murderers are indeed less common than male murderers, comprising only about 10% of homicides [10, 12]. However, relative to their overall participation in violent crime, women account for a larger proportion of serial murders than one-time murders, although still less frequent than males in absolute terms [14, 15]. Female serial killers are more likely to kill acquaintances or family members, such as spouses or children, and commit murders that do not involve the overt brutality often associated with male serial killers [4, 16]. This leads to less sensationalistic media coverage, further reducing public awareness [7].\n\nIn conclusion, the perception of female murderers as rare is influenced by societal norms and media representation, coupled with the genuine statistical infrequency of such crimes by women. Nonetheless, recognizing the distinct characteristics of female murderers is vital for a nuanced understanding of criminal behavior [5, 7].","probability":0.1281966943}

The term \"female serial killer\" was generally believed to be an oxymoron, in spite of the fact that some of our fairer citizens have consistently shown us that, when it comes to murder, a woman can compete with any man [4].

This phenomenon results in less coverage and acknowledgment of female murderers, despite evidence that suggests women can and do commit such crimes [4,8].\n\nStatistically, women commit a smaller proportion of homicides. For instance, data show women are responsible for only about 10% of murders in the U.S., and they are far less likely than men to be involved in serial killings [11,12,16]. Despite this, female serial killers do exist, comprising an estimated 15-20% of such offenders, which is a larger share compared to overall female involvement in murders [14,15]. However, these cases often go unnoticed due to their less sensational nature compared to their male counterparts, who frequently employ brutal methods that capture public attention [4,9].\n\nAdditionally, societal perceptions of gender roles contribute to the underestimation of female murderers. Women are stereotypically viewed as nurturing, which contrasts with societal images of murder, leading to disbelief and less scrutiny toward female suspects [0,1]. Even when female killers are documented, they are often assigned trivializing nicknames, which diminishes the perceived severity of their actions [0].

Generally, conservatives recognize the importance of addressing mental health issues, although attitudes may vary on the specifics of policy implementation. Broadly, conservatives emphasize personal responsibility and favor solutions that mitigate the role of government intervention. This preference is evident in discussions surrounding mental health care, where many conservatives advocate for privatized health systems and reduced governmental oversight to lower costs and encourage competition in healthcare delivery [10].\n\nIn public policy, especially around incidents of mass shootings, conservatives frequently highlight the need for better identification and treatment of mental-health issues as a means to prevent violence, rather than implementing stricter gun controls [2,3]. This reflects a belief in mental health reform as a preventative measure, suggesting that addressing mental illness could mitigate the underlying causes of some violent actions [4].\n\nMoreover, conservative perspectives acknowledge the ability of those with mental illnesses to lead productive lives with the right support, challenging outdated stereotypes that paint mentally ill individuals as irrevocably incapacitated [0].

It is often called the \"oldest profession,\" since it has long been cited in history and it can be found in different cultures around the world [6,18]. \n\nProstitution between consenting adults is often called a \"victimless crime\" since both the seller and buyer consent to the act and neither of the persons involved feel they are being taken advantage of [0,2,3,12,13,14,15]. Some people say this form of prostitution between consenting adults should not be criminalized [14,12,2,0]. The emphasis must be placed on \"consenting adults\" since children are not able to consent to being involved in sex acts and no one could rightly argue that prostitution involving children should not be a crime. \n\nWhen it comes to the criminilization of prostitution among consenting adults, however, the arguments are largely based on the harm most people feel it does to society.\n\nArguments for making prostitution a crime include its contribution to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases: the possibility of women being exploited;  increased drug abuse being linked to prostitution; the danger of children being drawn into the sex industry; and human trafficking [0,1,2,7,8].\n\nIt is felt that persons having random sex (as the clients of prostitutes often do) or persons with multiple sex partners (as is the case with prostitutes) increase the chances of STDs becoming widespread [15,12,9,7,2,1,0].\n\nTrafficking and the recruitment of children in the sex industry are also a major issue, leading many to support its criminalization[2,8,13,17,19].

The origins of criminalization can be traced back to the Progressive era, during which a wave of regulatory laws was introduced across the states, leading to the near nationwide outlawing of prostitution by the mid-20th century, with the exception of certain areas in Nevada where prostitution is strictly regulated [0,3,6,8]. Legal frameworks against prostitution are largely designed to protect public health and safety and to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable individuals, particularly minors [1,2,17].\n\nProstitution is often debated as either a \"victimless crime\" between consenting adults or an exploitative practice fraught with potential harms and societal consequences. Proponents of criminalization argue that prostitution contributes to the degradation and exploitation of individuals, predominantly women, and is often linked to other criminal activities such as human trafficking [0,12,13]. Moreover, concerns over public health, including the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, are cited as practical reasons for its prohibition [0,1,9].\n\nWhile moral and ethical considerations play a significant role in maintaining its illegal status, arguments also revolve around broader societal impacts. Some suggest that removing the illegality of prostitution could reduce its associated hazards, allowing sex workers similar legal protections as other professions [9,15]. However, the prevalent view remains that the criminalization of prostitution serves to uphold public welfare, social order, and moral standards [0,1,7].\n\nIn conclusion, the criminality of prostitution emerges from intertwined legal, moral, and societal concerns, underscoring a complex debate about individual freedoms, public health, and societal values.","probability":0.1022847284}

In real-world markets, this is neither healthy for both sellers and buyers nor for markets [6]. This is because pure competition assumes that all the products are identical meaning there is no difference between the competitors' unique selling proposition (USP) [5]. In reality, these USPs do exist to differentiate both the products and services. This can be through branding, marketing, the customer approach, the features of the product and customer services as well as the quality variation of the product of the same niche [8]. All real facts make pure competition an unrealistic model and hence it becomes unsustainable even if imposed on markets [9, 10]. Secondly, the perfect information for both sellers and consumers is a myth [10, 11, 12]. The complete knowledge cannot be grasped by anyone about prices, quality and availability. In the real world, this happens rarely due to continuously changing market trends, the demand and supply gap and emerging marketing strategies [12]. Furthermore, the pure competition assumes that there are no barriers to entering the market and exiting it [13]. In the real world of business and markets, there are many check points and barriers to regulations and policies and many factors to enter into the market and exiting from the market [13, 14]. Pure competition is imperfect or say in more that is unrealistic one. The real market is governed through imperfect competition [7]. Also pure competition does not account for externalities, it also have little incentives to invest in innovation and research and hence the product become outdated sooner than later [15].

The premise of pure competition involves numerous sellers offering identical products, with no single entity able to influence market prices, which are set entirely by supply and demand dynamics. This theoretical framework necessitates perfect information and homogeneity among products, conditions which are scarcely met in real-world markets [8,9]. \n\nThe unsustainability of pure competition primarily arises from the economic pressures it places on producers. A fundamental issue is the inability of producers to sustain profits in a pure competition model, as the relentless drive for maintaining parity in pricing erodes profit margins over time [2,4,5]. With many producers in the marketplace, the competition often becomes a race to the bottom, with prices potentially falling below production costs, thus threatening the very viability of businesses [0,1]. Furthermore, the model\u2019s constraints on product differentiation and innovation hamper firms' ability to distinguish themselves and offer unique value, which is a significant driver of competitive advantage in actual markets [10,12,15]. \n\nConsequently, pure competition remains theoretical with its assumptions rarely observed in reality. An environment lacking in innovation and profit potential diminishes its applicability as a sustainable business model. Instead, market structures like monopolistic competition or oligopoly, which allow for strategic pricing and product differentiation, are seen as more realistic and sustainable.

The FRA, responsible for regulating all passenger and freight rail operations in the United States, maintains a nationwide inspection staff of about 400, supplemented by around 160 state-employed inspectors participating in a state program [0]. However, the vast scope of operations and responsibilities, including conducting inspections and investigations, developing enforcement actions, and engaging in educational activities, places a significant workload on this limited staff.\n\nOne underlying reason for understaffing relates to budgetary constraints. Often, agencies face financial pressures which lead to cutbacks in their workforce to manage expenses effectively [2,3]. Such financial limitations may deter hiring or replacing retiring inspectors, exacerbating staffing shortages. Furthermore, the exigency of expert inspectors in specific safety disciplines implies the necessity for specialized knowledge and training that might not be promptly available in the labor market, complicating recruitment efforts [0].\n\nThe effects of such understaffing are profound. Inadequate staffing levels can hinder the agency's ability to efficiently perform its tasks, potentially compromising rail safety and operational efficiency. The burden of insufficient personnel often results in worker exhaustion and decreased productivity, further aggravating the situation as inspectors struggle to meet the high demands of their roles [3].

This trend continued through the Great Depression, which saw further federal expansion to mitigate economic collapse through regulatory frameworks and social programs[0,1].

The watermelon market operates in a supply and demand cycle. When the prices of watermelons are lower, more consumers are enticed to buy them, hence demand increases. However, if the supply cannot meet the number of watermelons demanded, a shortage occurs [2,3,5,6,7,9]. The supply may not meet demand in a number of ways. First, the suppliers may produce less watermelons because of lower potential profit from an oversupply of watermelons. This means the supply of watermelons will not meet the amount consumers want (the demand), causing a shortage and the price of the watermelons to go up again [3,5,6]. These prices cannot exceed a maximum limit if the government chooses to intervene and protect consumers [4,6]. This cap can result in some suppliers opting-out of the supply chain, decreasing supply and causing a shortage [4,6]. Also, if the weather conditions are not ideal for pollination, and hence production, there will be less watermelons grown, thus decreasing the supply and creating a shortage [2,4,10]. On top of that, watermelons generally grow in a limited time of the year, so if demand is high when less watermelons are being grown, a shortage can occur [6,7]. Demand has grown in the U.S. in recent years, and even though there are methods from the watermelon industry to address those demands, shortages can still occur due to its limitations [8].","probability":0.095843611}

In 1994, the government split up the company and privatized the track infrastructure separately from passenger service operating companies [15,16].

Some studies say that this is because of the sixth sense but the majority of the studies relate it to psychology [8]. This feeling of being watched happens with so many people, even when no one is there in the home [8]. Psychologists further refer to this process as blindsight [10].

Humans possess a finely-tuned sense of gaze detection, evolved as a defense mechanism to assess potential threats or social interactions in their environment. This ability to sense being watched stems from our brain\u2019s capacity to process signals that are not consciously seen but are nonetheless detected through peripheral vision and other sensory inputs[0,1,2]. \n\nOur brains are naturally inclined to detect gazes due to the evolutionary imperative of discerning threats, such as predators or hostile individuals. This hyper-vigilance leads us to sometimes incorrectly assume we are being observed, especially in situations where visual cues are ambiguous, such as when someone wears sunglasses[4,5]. This propensity is partly rooted in human egocentrism and the innate tendency to feel as if one is the center of attention in any given social context[0,6].\n\nAdditionally, the brain processes visual information beyond our conscious perception. Studies on individuals with visual impairments, such as cortically blind subjects, demonstrate that the brain still receives and processes visual cues, indicating how vision is part of a broader sensory evaluation system[3,8]. Consequently, while the eerie sensation of being watched may feel uncanny, it is an interplay of evolutionary psychology, cognitive processing, and perhaps an overzealous application of survival instincts. These factors collectively account for why people often feel watched, even in the absence of overt gazes[1,6].","probability":0.0712370175}

This perception can often be attributed to the brain's ability to pick up subtle cues from the environment, such as peripheral movements or even sounds, which trigger the feeling that someone is watching [0,2]. It is assumed that this heightened sensitivity to gaze may have evolved as a survival mechanism, allowing humans to detect potential threats from predators or other humans [4,6].\n\nPsychological studies suggest that when direct visual cues are ambiguous or obscured, such as someone wearing sunglasses, individuals may mistakenly assume they are being observed. This is because the human brain tends to generate assumptions based on partial visual information, effectively creating a self-fulfilling prophecy [4,19]. This perceptual bias is not solely based on visual input; experiences and subconscious processing also play crucial roles [5,16].\n\nInterestingly, research on individuals with blindsight\u2014who are cortically blind yet still process visual information unconsciously\u2014demonstrates that the brain can sense staring even without conscious sight. This condition highlights the brain\u2019s complex mechanisms in interpreting social cues [3,11].

Aging processes and other individual variations can lead to changes in canthal tilt, sometimes necessitating corrective cosmetic procedures if a more youthful or aesthetically pleasing tilt is desired.\n\nSurgical interventions such as canthoplasty or lateral retinacular canthoplasty are employed to correct or enhance the canthal tilt. These procedures typically involve tightening and elevating the lateral canthus to recreate or support a positive tilt [0,1,2,4]. By adjusting the canthal positioning, these surgeries serve both cosmetic and reconstructive purposes, contributing to a refreshed and harmonious facial appearance [1,4,7].\n\nIn conclusion, a positive canthal tilt is regarded as a key component of facial aesthetics.

Canthoplasty is a type of optic surgery in which surgeon opens the eyelids and tighten and harden muscle tendons [0]. As a result the Lateral canthus becomes higher the medical canthus i.e positive canthal tilt [0]. Rarely people looks for negative or neutral canthal tilt [0]. \nIn this procedure, lower eyelids are augmented with blepharoplasty by using a method called Lateral Retinacular Canthoplasty [1]. By this method, the lateral canthus becomes tightened and elevated as a result of which canthal tilt becomes positive which makes one look better than that of neutral or negative canthal tilt [1,3]. Usually, the procedure involves splitting the canthal angle and cutting the lateral canthal tendon away from the lateral orbital rim [2,3]. The lower lid is then shortened and a new lateral canthal angle created using stitches [2,3]. During outer canthoplasty, the lateral canthus is tightened and elevated [2,3]. This allows the surgeon to accurately restore a positive canthal tilt, and ideally create a more natural appearance [2,3]. \nCanthoplasty is a specialized procedure which is carried out by highly professional Oculoplastic surgeons, sometimes the cosmetics surgeons as well [1]. The end result of canthoplasty is that it improves your facial appearance and your eyes look wider just like cat eyes in style [1]. The procedure is performed by applying local anesthetics or sometimes with intravenous sedation [1].

For instance, some states actively impose the death penalty, while others have abolished it altogether, leading to discrepancies in how quickly or whether a death sentence is carried out [6,7].\n\nMoreover, the judicial process involved in capital punishment cases is often lengthy and complex, involving numerous appeals and reviews, which can delay the execution of some killers compared to others.

Officially, no legal voting rights exist for citizens, male or female, in the conventional sense, as common in democratic states. Instead, the Pope is elected by the College of Cardinals, a body entirely composed of male clerics, and only cardinals under the age of 80 have the right to vote in papal elections [3,7]. The inability of women to vote ties into the broader exclusion from ordination, as women cannot become cardinals, a prerequisite for voting in the papal conclave [1,6]. \n\nThis exclusion reflects the Catholic Church's longstanding tradition of male-only clergy. The Church asserts that this tradition is based on religious beliefs about the role of women in accordance with the example set by Jesus, who selected male apostles [4,5]. Hence, female participation in high-level Church decisions remains restricted.\n\nDespite the absence of traditional voting rights, discussions about reforming gender policies within the Church have surfaced, particularly under Pope Francis, who has shown support for gender equality in other realms, such as equal pay [0,1]. Nonetheless, progress on allowing women greater roles in Church governance, including voting rights in Vatican City, remains limited.\n\nIn conclusion, the restriction on women's voting rights in Vatican City is primarily rooted in religious tradition and the unique political structure of the Vatican as a religious sovereign state, where political and religious functions intertwine with male-only ecclesiastical appointments [8].","probability":0.0736364195}

Women, being ineligible to become cardinals, are therefore barred from participating in any electoral process [1,3,4,7].\n\nThe Church's stance on women's suffrage is influenced by its interpretation of religious texts and historical doctrines.

However, this may not be the case with all individuals. The word \u201cFree\u201d works on people\u2019s brains differently than other words [17,18]. Under normal circumstances, when faced with multiple choices consumers commonly choose the free option. With the opportunity to receive something for free, the actual value of the product or service is no longer considered [0,2]. Behavioral scientist Dan Ariely insists that zero is a special price that not only decreases an item\u2019s cost but increases its value [16]. This is because consumers perceive free stuff to be more valuable than discounts [15]. For example, people would choose a free Hershey\u2019s Kiss over a 14-cent Lindt truffle (and Lindt is generally considered a richer, superior chocolate) [7,8]. Sometimes, people will ignore better value offers just because they are getting something for free [17,18]. When the price is set to free, people take things they don\u2019t need and forego better deals because they think \u2018free\u2019 comes at no cost [4,6]. Conversely, however, the perceived value of a free item can become negatively skewed when it is considered in isolation. Since the package offered by the seller is free, customers might get the perception that all versions offered by the seller are worth very little[12,13]. It is often the satisfaction that comes from not paying for a free item that increases any perceived value it has to consumers, as opposed to the intrinsic value of the item itself. Free things may be easier to lose or take for granted considering they cost the owner nothing initially.","probability":0.0814226263}

A significant factor is the psychological allure of the word \"free,\" which generates an emotional response that often overrides rational evaluation of the actual worth of the item or service being offered. This phenomenon, described by behavioral economist Dan Ariely, suggests that the concept of \"free\" gives an emotional charge to the transaction, making the free item appear more valuable than it truly is, despite any potential downsides or opportunity costs involved [0, 1, 4, 9].\n\nAdditionally, the perception of value decreases because individuals do not feel the \"pain of paying\" when acquiring free items, which can lead them to ignore more valuable offers that require payment [4, 6]. This bias towards obtaining something for free\u2014even at the expense of better deals\u2014can be explained by loss aversion, as individuals naturally gravitate towards avoiding losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains [9]. Moreover, when products are habitually offered for free, it can subconsciously devalue the perception of those goods, leading consumers to believe that they have less intrinsic worth, a problem seen in the freemium business model [10, 12].\n\nIn conclusion, the perceived value of free items is lessened due to the emotional and psychological impulses that make people disregard rational reasoning about the item's value. The word \"free\" acts as a powerful influencer, altering consumer decisions and leading to irrational behavior in consumption choices. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for consumers and businesses aiming to optimize their value propositions and pricing strategies.","probability":0.0913432087}

While free offers can be seen as immensely valuable because there is no immediate cost, they can create an illusion of value that outweighs the actual worth of the item or service. Behavioral economist Dan Ariely highlights this paradox by emphasizing that people underestimate the opportunity costs associated with free items, often ignoring better alternatives that are not free due to the seductive nature of the word \"free\" [0, 2, 4, 9]. \n\nMoreover, consumers' emotional response to receiving something with no monetary cost can lead to irrational decision-making. There is a psychological \"pain of paying\" that consumers try to avoid, hence a preference for items labeled as free, even when they could get more value with paid options. For instance, consumers might overvalue a free Hershey's Kiss over a more valuable but not free Lindt truffle [7, 8]. \n\nThe appeal of free can also backfire on businesses. For example, the use of freemium models might devalue the perceived worth of a product if customers equate free versions with low quality or assume that all versions are of little value [10, 12]. Marketers exploit this by using free offerings as marketing tactics to attract initial engagement, hoping to convert users to paying customers later [0, 16].\n\nOverall, the perception of value for free items and offers is complex, often leading consumers to prioritize immediate, albeit illusory, gratifications over potentially more beneficial choices.","probability":0.0700054277}

In the modern education, teachers create logical people who can live rationally with others [10]. Additionally, teachers are given control over the students.

However, its impact on government education schemes remains limited. One primary reason is the inherent conflict between postmodernist principles and the structured nature of public education systems. While postmodernism promotes fluidity, diversity, and a multiplicity of perspectives, traditional education systems are often rooted in standardized curricula designed to deliver consistent outcomes across diverse populations [9,11].\n\nEducation systems tend to be bureaucratically controlled and emphasize universal standards, which contrasts sharply with postmodernism's rejection of such uniformity and its insistence on localized knowledges and practices [0,5]. Furthermore, postmodern principles challenge long-standing educational practices by promoting critical thinking over factual learning, and by giving students more control over their learning processes [6,8]. However, this decentralization can be challenging to implement on a large scale within government frameworks that focus on accountability and measurable outcomes [13].\n\nMoreover, traditional educational institutions have been slow to adapt to postmodernist ideals due to political and social resistance. The integration of postmodern concepts often faces pushback from stakeholders who view them as undermining established educational values and structures [13,0]. Thus, while postmodernism has theoretically impacted educational philosophy by encouraging critical thinking and inclusivity, its practical application within government education schemes remains constrained by institutional and socio-political barriers [4,13].\n\nIn summary, while postmodernism influences educational discourse, practical challenges and institutional inertia have limited its integration into government education schemes.","probability":0.0875519338}

This standardization involves rigorous testing regimes that prioritize quantitative outcomes over the qualitative, critical thinking, and individualized learning approaches emphasized by postmodernism[6,7].\n\nPostmodern educational theory advocates for transformation away from the constraints of traditional, didactic methods and towards styles that recognize and cater to the unique learning styles of individual students.

Even compared on a nation-to-nation level, the budget for teachers' salaries is much lower [1]. One reason for this is due to overall tax cuts in education from the 2008 recession, where spending in 29 states have not returned to pre-recession levels [2,7,13,14]. Another reason for the lack of  overall spending is because of increased cost of living across different states [1,3,4,5,6,9,13]. Salaries have not been able to keep up with inflation, and as a result, teachers are incentivize to move to states to find a decent living [16]. Wealth inequality also correlates with educational spending. States with higher teachers' salaries correlate with higher budgets and per-student spending because of distribution policies for the state. \"Schools with more low-income students tend to receive less per-pupil spending within districts because the higher-paid teachers with greater experience often transfer to schools with more-advantaged students who are less difficult to educate.\" [15] Extracurricular activities and non-core classes also tend to have less students, making the ratio of per-student spending higher. These state policies incentivizes qualified teachers to work in places that are already affluent, creating an educational spending gap as compared with lower-income areas where there are often higher student populations and less opportunities for non-core classes and extracurriculars [10,12,13,16,17,19].

Firstly, historical factors such as the budgetary cuts during the 2008 recession still impact current funding levels.

Inflation-adjusted decreases in teacher salaries exacerbated this problem, with Colorado teachers experiencing a 15% decline in real wages since the 1999-2000 school year [4,6]. \n\nSecondly, socio-economic and political realities influence education funding. Colorado's teacher salaries rank among the lowest due to inadequate state funding and cost-of-living disparities [0,5]. The economic structure whereby school funding is heavily reliant on local property taxes leads to disparities between wealthier and poorer districts, which often receive less financial support [12,19]. Additionally, Colorado teachers struggle with salaries that do not meet basic living expenses, like health insurance and housing, contributing to strikes and advocacy for better compensation [4,6].\n\nFurthermore, structural issues in educational expenditures contribute to the problem. The U.S. allocates a smaller portion of educational spending to teacher salaries than other OECD countries, further diminishing teachers' relative income compared to other professionals [1]. This allocation often leads to unattractive salary conditions for teachers and diverges from the recommended investment in frontline educators.\n\nIn conclusion, Colorado's low teacher income and per-student spending is the result of historical budgetary constraints, socio-economic inequalities, and political and structural funding decisions.

Graff and Rackham explain to Ender that instead of waiting for the Buggers to attack, Earth has sent warships to the Bugger\u2019s home world. They are training Ender to command the fleet. When Ender wants to know why Rackham does not command the fleet himself, Rackham tells Ender that he must be in command because he is faster, a better fighter, and less cautious than Rackham. Ender begins training on a new battle simulator where, instead of commanding ships, he now commands an entire fleet. His squadron leaders turn out to be the best students from Battle School, most of them Ender\u2019s friends [9].\n\n- The final battle consisted of the destruction of the Bugger homeworld and the apparent eradication of the Bugger species. Ender is hailed as a hero, but he is stricken with guilt for having unknowingly committed genocide. Valentine informs him that in the wake of the war, he would never be allowed to return to Earth due to her actions to protect him from Peter, who was becoming a major political force on Earth [10].","probability":0.0493991687}

During his time at Battle School, Ender became entangled in escalating conflicts with other students, most notably with Bonzo Madrid, who harbored a grudge against him after a series of defeats. This animosity culminated in a violent encounter where Ender, in self-defense, inadvertently killed Bonzo [0, 1, 2]. Despite Ender's victory in the Bugger War and his strategic genius being universally recognized, these events shadowed him post-war because his actions led to unintended fatalities, which were never fully disclosed to him at the time [9, 12].\n\nFurthermore, the political climate on Earth after the war also threatened Ender's safety. His brother, Peter, who sought political power and manipulation under the alias of Locke, played a pivotal role in ensuring that Ender could not return to Earth, partly to protect him from becoming a pawn in political maneuvers and partly to keep Ender out of Peter's way [10, 14]. This exile forced him to find a new role on a colonizing mission, severing his ties with Earth and its political strife [13, 14].\n\nIn conclusion, Ender's continued danger after the war arises from both personal vendettas and complex political agendas that sought to utilize his capabilities while keeping him at arm's length from Earthly affairs.

A recurrent theme is the oversupply of agricultural commodities amidst stalling or insufficient demand growth, which continues to exert downward pressure on prices. The substantial production of key crops such as wheat, corn, and soybeans, particularly in major producing nations like the United States, Russia, and Brazil, has led to stockpiles reaching unprecedented levels, thus contributing to the pricing collapse observed in these markets [7,17,18].\n\nMoreover, the global economic slowdown, particularly in China, has further weakened demand for agricultural commodities. China's transition to a more sustainable growth model has significantly reduced its import appetite for raw materials, adversely impacting global commodity prices [0,1,5]. Concurrently, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has made dollar-priced commodities more expensive for foreign buyers, reducing international demand further [3,4].\n\nThe effects of climate phenomena such as El Ni\u00f1o, while having significant localized impacts, have not influenced global prices substantially due to the ample global supply conditions. Some regions experienced disruptions, but these were not enough to offset broader global trends [1,8].\n\nIn conclusion, the crash in food commodity prices is driven by an excess in global supply combined with weakened demand due to slower economic growth and a strong dollar, creating a market environment unfavorable to price increases [0,7,8]. This suggests a need for strategic interventions and adjustments in both production and trade policies to restore balance in commodity markets.","probability":0.0786611552}

A confluence of macroeconomic factors has driven these downward trends in recent months, exacerbated by fluctuating global supply and demand dynamics. Several key elements have been identified as contributors to this downturn.\n\nThe primary driver of falling food prices is the abundance in agricultural supply. High levels of production for key staples such as corn, soybeans, wheat, and rice have resulted in substantial inventory surpluses. For instance, the U.S. and other major grain-producing nations have reported record harvests, leading to increased stockpiles and reduced market prices [8,13,18]. Moreover, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has made dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies, further dampening global demand [4,8].\n\nAdditional factors influencing the downturn include China's economic transition towards more sustainable growth, which has lessened its import demand for various commodities, including food [0,5]. Low overall investment demand, compounded by geopolitical tensions and trade barriers, notably between the U.S. and China, have further affected agricultural exports [11].\n\nFurthermore, the global economic slowdown stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to weigh on market expectations, as subdued industrial activity worldwide affects demand for agricultural commodities [2,3].

Outdated curriculum and a lack of requirements within social studies and classes has allowed schools to entirely miss the topic black history [0].

Slavery and civil rights are often times the only two public school lessons involving black history [2]. The lack of teaching regarding black history can often times lead to insensitivity and the mistreatment of black or African Americans [3]. Initiatives to try and reframe the teaching US history, such as 1619 Project, are often times met with pushback from lawmakers. Such initiatives are seen as highly controversial and \"revisionist accounts\" of history [4, 5]. Black history is much more than oppression but often times schools only teach about how oppression was overcome by black America [2, 6]. As many areas of the country will grow up with little, and in some cases zero, interaction with black Americans, it is imperative that black history be taught in more depth in schools. This lack of education often times lends itself to individuals relying on stereotypes portrayed in media as their understanding of black America [9].

Instead, the issue lies in the inadequate or incomplete representation of Black history within the existing curricula. This inadequacy results from systemic neglect and the controversial nature of Black history's portrayal, which some perceive as revisionist or divisive when it aims to address the complexities of America's racial past. As a result, efforts to include comprehensive Black history are uneven across the United States, depending heavily on state legislation and enforcement [0, 4, 5].\n\nHistorically, laws during the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States explicitly prohibited African Americans from receiving education, fearing that literacy would inspire rebellion and threaten the institution of slavery [11, 12]. This legacy of educational inequity persists in contemporary debates about how Black history should be taught. For instance, projects like the New York Times' 1619 Project, which seeks to reframe American history by emphasizing the impact of slavery, have faced legislative attempts to restrict their implementation in schools, citing concerns over historical accuracy and social divisiveness [4, 5].\n\nTeaching Black history comprehensively is crucial for fostering an accurate understanding of America's past, promoting cultural appreciation, and combating xenophobia and racism [1, 3].

Instead, the issue often lies in inadequate representation and controversy over specific educational content. There is a clear distinction between teaching Black history comprehensively and the selective or minimal exposure that students frequently receive. The educational curriculum on Black history is often limited to major topics such as slavery and the civil rights movement, overlooking other significant historical events like the Great Migration or contributions of African Americans in various fields [2,6].\n\nState mandates exist in places like Illinois and Florida for including Black history in school curricula, but enforcement lacks rigor, leading to inconsistent teaching practices [0]. Some states face political opposition to specific curriculums that emphasize the centrality of slavery in American history, such as the 1619 Project, leading to legislative attempts to ban such content. These efforts are often driven by the perception that they offer a revisionist view of history [4,5].\n\nHistorically, the roots of inadequate Black history education are deep, stretching back to laws in the pre-Civil War era that banned African Americans from learning to read and write, under fears of rebellion [12,14].

Genocide can be prevented, and doing so is a collective responsibility. The response to the threat of genocide must be one of prevention and timely interception as it is less costly than intervening to halt the crime or attempts at dealing with its aftermath. Prevention is the only way to avoid the loss of human life, trauma, and physical injury. Additionally, failing to avert serious and gross breaches of international human rights and humanitarian law constitutes threats to international peace and security [5]. Genocides and Crimes Against Humanity are not spontaneous acts. Scholars in the field of genocide studies have identified a set of widely agreed upon risk factors that make a country or social group more at risk of carrying out a genocide, which includes a wide range of political and cultural factors that create a context in which genocide is more likely, [12]. According to George Mason University professor Gregory H. Stanton, the stages of genocide are nonlinear, predictable, and preventable. There are ten stages of genocide, and each stage can be stopped if preventive measures are taken [13,14,15]. In many cases, those who are not subjected to direct violence by the perpetrators of violence are victims of extreme poverty, as their economic prospects are extremely limited by government abuses and bias. The key to preventing further genocides is to punish perpetrators after they occur and intervene as the initial stages occur [19].","probability":0.0539957398}

Genocide is not merely the mass extermination of individuals; it is an attack against humanity itself, undermining fundamental human rights and the shared values that sustain peaceful coexistence [3,4]. The historical narrative of the 20th century, which witnessed genocides across different regions, serves as a poignant reminder of the failure to uphold the promise of \"never again\" [3].\n\nThe eradication of genocide is crucial because it represents not only the loss of human life but also leaves enduring trauma and social fragmentation. Preventing these atrocities contributes to the maintenance of peace and security, both nationally and internationally, as genocide poses substantial threats to regional stability and global order [5]. Furthermore, genocide prevention is a cost-effective measure compared to interventions required to halt ongoing atrocities and address their aftermath [5].\n\nMoreover, preventing genocide requires a collective commitment from individuals, nations, and international bodies. It involves recognizing early warning signs, fostering societal resilience through robust laws and accountable governance, and promoting an inclusive civil society that manages diversity constructively [4,6]. The Responsibility to Protect doctrine emphasizes that states have an obligation to protect their populations, with the international community acting as a safeguard when individual states do not fulfill this duty [4].\n\nIn conclusion, preventing another genocide is fundamentally about safeguarding humanity.

Historically, genocides have claimed more lives than conventional international wars, underscoring the immense scale of suffering and disruption they cause [9].\n\nThe prevention of genocide not only averts the immediate loss of life but also contributes to broader regional and international stability.

White blood cells are the defense forces of the body. When there is an infection (viral or bacterial), more white blood cells are generated and released into the bloodstream [5]. In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), WBC counts are usually above 15,000\/microL [3].\nAdults also have a higher WBC count than children. An elevated white blood cell count above the mentioned range is usually a sign of infection, often caused by several factors [5]. A high WBC count in the blood indicates the body's immune system is fighting an infection. A WBC count >15,000\/mm3 strongly suggests a bacterial, particularly a pneumococcal, etiology. A WBC count >20,000\/mm3 is associated with a poor prognosis and may indicate an occult pneumonia in children [2]. Children with perforated appendicies also have WBCs exceeding 15,000 cells\/\u03bcL [4].\nPeople with elevated WBC over 15,000 cells per microliter of blood may experience hot flashes, fatigue, sore joints, swollen lymph nodes, and other symptoms [5].

Inflation has driven up the prices of essential food items used in school lunches, such as milk and bread, thereby increasing the overall cost of providing these meals. Schools, which are obliged to meet federal nutrition guidelines, face a dilemma as they strive to balance cost with quality. Consequently, options like organic and locally grown produce, which have been integrated into menus to promote healthier eating, are at risk of being eliminated to cut costs [0, 1, 3].\n\nThe financial burden is exacerbated by a discrepancy between the actual cost of meal preparation and federal reimbursements. Despite the federal reimbursement rate being consistent across districts, some areas face a stark difference between the cost of food and what they receive in reimbursements. This gap is particularly pronounced in lower-income areas where a higher proportion of students rely on subsidized meals [11, 17]. As a result, many schools are forced to use reserve funds or increase meal prices, which may drive some families to opt out of school lunches entirely [1, 2, 14].\n\nIn conclusion, inflation has indeed adversely affected the quality of school lunches by imposing financial constraints that limit the variety and nutritional value of food that can be served. To address these challenges, it is crucial for policymakers to consider increasing funding and providing greater flexibility in nutrition guidelines to ensure that schools can continue to offer healthy and affordable meals to all students.","probability":0.1167767042}

One proposed intervention is the implementation of \"heavy usage\" pop-up warnings to alert users to potentially harmful overuse[0,1,10]. Additionally, there is a suggestion to flag digitally manipulated images, which often exacerbate self-esteem and body image issues, particularly among adolescents[0,1]. Educational initiatives are also emphasized, advocating for the inclusion of \"safe social media use\" in school curriculums, aiming to equip young people with skills to navigate these platforms safely[0,3].\n\nThe consequences of excessive social media usage are well-documented, including disruptions to sleep, anxiety, and depression, which are linked to increased time spent online[6,15]. Despite the recommendations, much of the regulatory responsibility falls on social media companies themselves, who are encouraged to adopt these practices voluntarily[10]. Furthermore, there is an ongoing need for public awareness campaigns and further research to understand the complex relationship between social media usage patterns and mental wellbeing[4,6].\n\nIn conclusion, while various frameworks and recommendations exist to address the negative impacts of social media on mental health, the absence of a unified national policy means that responses largely depend on educational initiatives and commitments from social media companies.

Many states, such as Ohio and Indiana, emphasize the critical nature of these assessments in holding districts, schools, and teachers accountable, as well as ensuring that students receive necessary educational services [0, 1]. Furthermore, federal funding can be tied to test participation rates, underscoring the importance of maintaining high levels of student involvement [1].\n\nAdditionally, parents usually have the right to be informed about their children's assessments, which aligns with broader educational policies promoting parental involvement [9]. Notification enables parents to discuss testing procedures and results, helping them to better understand their child's academic progress and engage effectively with educators [11]. In some jurisdictions, if a student is not taking part in these assessments, schools are required to inform parents about the implications of non-participation [3].\n\nExplicit communication from schools about testing schedules, purpose, and consequences fosters transparency and helps parents adequately prepare their children for the tests.

The energy burden is higher for lower-income households and those with no income at all [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9,12]. Furthermore, the increasing cost of energy means this burden is becoming greater [9,12]. \n\nSecondly, more and more households are having to choose between paying their utility bills and the things we traditionally see as basic needs, such as food [0,3,4,5,11,12,13]. The catch-22 for many people is that paying for utilities is a basic need since their heat and water depend on it.\n\nA third cause of the inability to pay utilities is that the bill is indeed high (or at least higher than it could be) because the individual lives in a low-efficiency home [0,4,18]. Such homes are especially found in low to middle-income communities, increasing the burden on householders in these communities.\n\nSome individuals face an inability to pay for their utilities simply because their financial situation has changed [14]. This may have happened for any of a number of reasons, including having a contributing family member move out of the home, having to spend more on childcare, sudden and unplanned for medical expenses, layoffs, wage reduction, and having to take care of an aging parent [12,14].\n\nLastly, unforeseen situations like the COVID pandemic and wildfires may upset the delicate balance some persons have been able to establish between paying for utilities and taking care of their other expenses [13,14,16,17,19].\n\nAny one of these factors can affect a person's ability to pay for utilities but, it is also important to keep in mind that some persons are affected by more than one of them simultaneously.","probability":0.0959784733}

Foremost among these is the concept of energy burden, which refers to the percentage of household income spent on energy costs. Low-income households face disproportionately higher energy burdens, spending between 7.2% to 10% of their income on utilities, compared to wealthier households that spend around 2.3% to 3%[0,1,3]. This disparity arises because low-income homes are often less energy efficient, compelling residents to allocate a larger portion of their finances to utilities[2,4].\n\nIn addition to income levels, demographic factors further affect the ability to pay utilities. Households of racial minorities, especially Black and Latino families, are more likely to experience utility disconnections, even within similar income brackets[5]. This reflects broader systemic inequalities, where marginalized communities face higher living costs and limited access to affordable utilities.\n\nGeographic location also plays a crucial role, as energy burden can be as high as 30% in certain areas depending on local climate demands and energy prices[2]. Moreover, economic instability, as witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbates these burdens by further diminishing household incomes and increasing utility reliance for essential services such as heating and electricity[13].\n\nConclusively, the ability to pay utility bills is affected by a complex interplay of income, energy efficiency, demographic factors, and geographic location.

One primary challenge this presents is age discrimination, commonly known as ageism, which affects individuals typically starting at age 40 and above. Despite legal protections, such as the Age Discrimination in Employment Act in the U.S., ageism remains prevalent and manifests in various workplace practices. This includes hiring biases, where older candidates may be unjustly perceived as less adaptable or technologically savvy than their younger counterparts, leading to fewer opportunities for advancement or hiring [1,5,9].\n\nFurthermore, stereotypes persist about older workers being less productive or unwilling to embrace change, which hinders their professional growth and undervalues their contributions [8,9,18]. Such perceptions can result in subtle exclusion from training and development opportunities, reinforcing the marginalization of older employees [7,12]. The consequences of age discrimination are significant, with many older workers either being pushed prematurely out of jobs or struggling in an environment that underutilizes their skills [5,16].\n\nAn additional challenge is the financial necessity for many older individuals to remain in the workforce due to inadequate retirement savings and longer life expectancies [2]. As the fastest-growing segment of the workforce, older employees bring valuable experience and knowledge, which should be leveraged rather than sidelined due to ageist biases [0,1,14].\n\nIn conclusion, addressing issues related to aging in the workplace requires both cultural change and policy enforcement to eliminate ageist stereotypes and practices. Embracing a diverse age spectrum within organizations not only upholds fairness but also harnesses the comprehensive skill sets that a multi-generational workforce offers.","probability":0.0839148991}

However, it was not until the 1960s and 1970s that salsa truly gained prominence in America.

This delay can be attributed to its gradual evolution and the socio-economic dynamics of the time.

These elements, along with American jazz influences, began to form the music known as salsa by the mid-20th century [6,9,10]. \n\nThe lack of early recognition in the United States was partly due to cultural and linguistic barriers, which limited its mainstream acceptance until the term \"salsa\" was popularized in the 1970s.

However, he quickly rescinded his loan after being appalled at their high proposed interest rates of 24%-36% [1,5,6,7,8,9,10].\n\nIn response to this, Lincoln was advised by Colonel Dick Taylor of Chicago to \"get congress to pass a bill authorising the printing of full legal tender treasury notes... and pay your soldiers with them and go ahead and win your war with them\" [9]. In April 1862, Lincoln had printed roughly 400 million dollars worth of these Treasury notes - also known as Greenbacks due to the green ink used on the back of the notes [0,1,2,3,5].

Rather than succumbing to these financial terms, Lincoln adopted a bold monetary strategy by creating the \"Greenbacks,\" which were debt-free and interest-free Treasury Notes[1,2,6].\n\nThese \"Greenbacks,\" amounting to approximately $400 million, were issued as legal tender to pay soldiers, civil service employees, and for war supplies, allowing the government to sustain the war effort without accruing additional debt from high-interest loans[1,3].

The Ottoman capture of Constantinople in 1453 caused Europeans to turn to sub-Saharan Africa to supply their demand for slaves. In addition, the Muslim Ottoman Turks controlled the eastern Mediterranean, which brought about the discovery of new sea routes. The search for gold, as well as the desire to discover an overseas route to the spice markets of India, were also objectives of Portuguese exploration. Furthermore, enterprising young men of the Spanish upper classes immigrated to the Americas in search of fortunes. Wealth was a driving motivation, and the quest for material profit was the basic reason for expansion. Political issues aided the financial problems of exploration. The outward push of Spain, France, and England is explained by the ambition for political centralization. The Spanish monarchy supported foreign ventures and bore the costs and dangers [2].\n\n- The conquest of much of the New World by Spanish conquistadors during those few years was surely one of history's turning points. Indeed, as Karl Marx and Adam Smith claimed, perhaps it was the greatest event in history. There were many who thought so at the time. The Aztec Empire was a powerful collection of city-states in what is today modern-day Mexico. It began as an alliance of three city-states, known as the Aztec Triple Alliance, which included Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan.

Arizona, leading to a Supreme Court decision in 1966 that profoundly changed police interrogation practices across the United States. The Supreme Court found that Miranda's confession, obtained without him being informed of his rights, was inadmissible. This was because Miranda was not made aware of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and his Sixth Amendment right to legal counsel during police interrogation[0,1,11].\n\nDuring his initial trial, Miranda had confessed to kidnapping and rape after extensive interrogation. He wasn't informed that he could remain silent or request a lawyer. Despite these facts, his confession was used to convict him[3,4,12]. His case was later appealed, and the Supreme Court ruled in a narrow 5-4 decision that such confessions obtained without advising the accused of their rights were inherently compelled[2,4]. This combination of rights has become known as the \"Miranda Rights,\" ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to prevent involuntary confessions during police questioning[0,15,17].\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court overturned the original conviction due to the procedural failure, Miranda was retried without the confession allowed as evidence and was still found guilty based on other compelling evidence[9,14].

One is that a government wants to operate the terrorist against other governments or its citizens to create a notion of sympathy or as false flag operations [1, 6]. The purpose of doing this is to create fear in the targeted population and create problems for the targeted government [3]. Some governments sponsor terrorism to support foreign policy or safeguard their national interests [6, 8]. One of the secondary motives is political leverage as well, by supporting these groups, they can destabilize the rival government or create proxy forces [7]. Sharing of ideological and religious beliefs is another reason to support the fighters and terrorist groups [10, 11]. Because of this shared ideology, the government or state wants its ideology to be promoted with violence [12, 13]. One unique aspect to learn is that smaller states use state-sponsored terrorism as a form of asymmetric warfare, that allows them to challenge a stronger opponent in the region without direct military confrontation. Some weak governance states cover their weakness with false-flag operations by sponsoring terrorism against their civilians and this act diverts attention from mainstream hot issues.

Prayer is not banned in schools [0]. Children of all faiths are allowed to pray and even allowed to organize prayer in groups, but the school is not allowed to enforce a single, organized prayer [0]. This system allows access for those who want to pray without forcing participation on anyone [0].\nParents want their children to learn, but they want to pick and choose that knowledge [1]. There exists a myriad of reasons why parents will not relinquish the education of their children to others [1]. This has spawned the developing movement of homeschooling [1]. As a society, people have decided that their beliefs have more value, are more reliable, than objective truths [2]. They reinforce this every single day, from school age and onward into adulthood [2]. When Christian parents negatively overreact to the mere idea of evolution, they can quickly lose credibility with their kids for not understanding and interacting with the issues more deeply [3]. This basic concern with evolutionary theory has helped drive the decades-long opposition to teaching it in public schools [5]","probability":0.454401293}

Many parents, particularly those from Christian conservative backgrounds, perceive evolution as contradicting the biblical account of creation, specifically the belief in the creation of man in God's image, which they see as incompatible with humans evolving from animals [0,3,8,10]. This tension has historically fueled debates and legal challenges aimed at either prohibiting the teaching of evolution or promoting creationism and intelligent design as alternative theories in the classroom [0,6,11].\n\nFurthermore, some parents view the teaching of evolution as a challenge to traditional religious and moral values. For instance, the theory of evolution has been implicated in broader societal controversies, such as its perceived link to justifying social practices that some religious groups oppose, including changes in family dynamics and social norms [4,5,17]. Others argue that evolution is used by some atheists as a tool to criticize religious faith, which can heighten resistance from religious communities [0,5].\n\nThe controversy has not only involved religious groups but also sparked broader debates about the role of religious and scientific education in public schools, highlighting the ongoing challenge of balancing educational content with the diverse beliefs of students and their families [0,6,9]. Despite legal precedents that prohibit the exclusion of evolution from curricula, opposition continues, with some parents advocating for an educational framework that allows students to explore multiple perspectives on the origin of life [1,9].","probability":0.1018773527}

Renowned investor Warren Buffett is a staunch proponent of this approach, often advising investors to view stocks as ownership interests in businesses, rather than mere ticker symbols driven by daily market sentiments [1,8]. This perspective encourages investors to concentrate on the intrinsic value of companies rather than react to the often volatile market forecasts and media hype that can lead to poor investment decisions [1,6,18].\n\nThis investment strategy, rooted in value investing principles, argues that reacting to market noise can be detrimental, causing investors to buy high during optimism and sell low during pessimism, rather than capitalizing on sounder investment opportunities [2,5,9]. By ignoring the noise and focusing on long-term growth, investors can avoid the emotional pitfalls of the market and aim for more consistent returns [9,19].\n\nThe practice of ignoring market noise involves not acting on short-term price movements or market speculations, but rather investing in businesses with strong fundamentals and growth prospects, thereby potentially avoiding the costly errors associated with reactive trading [0,3,11]. This methodology, championed by figures like Buffett and other disciples of Benjamin Graham, remains a cornerstone of successful investing and is encouraged for building a resilient portfolio over time [6,10,12].","probability":0.0979692043}

While many people claim that they have become lactose intolerant overnight, this is uncommon. The condition typically develops over time with age, and in certain cases of accident and injury, the condition may develop all of a sudden. Some babies born too early (premature babies) may not be able to make enough lactase.

This is the inability of the body to produce enough lactase enzymes to break down lactose. Lactoses are sugar molecules naturally found in dairy products such as milk, cheese, ice cream, and yogurt [1]. Small intestines may fail to produce enough lactase enzymes due to injury or inflammation caused by celiac disease or bowel disorders [3,4,5]. Some children may also be born with underdeveloped small intestines, leading to less production of lactase [13]. The older population is also at risk of becoming lactose intolerant because the body produces less and less lactase or even stops as one age [8]. The condition allows the lactose to pass down to the large intestine undigested, where it reacts with the bacteria. This leads to abdominal pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and nausea [16]. However, the symptoms can vary from person to person depending on the amount of dairy products one consumes.\nA person does not become lactose intolerant overnight. The only times lactose tolerance can be described as sudden is when it is triggered by intestinal injury or illness [1]. It often happens gradually, and symptoms may go unnoticed or even ignored because they are less severe at the onset [3]. Both children and adults are susceptible to lactose intolerance. Unfortunately, lactose intolerance can be hereditary [0,14]. This means you are likely to experience it at some stage of your life if your family has a history of lactose intolerance. Still, it can also be caused by the factors already mentioned. Conclusively, one should always look for signs of lactose intolerance to identify it early enough for possible treatment.

Lactose intolerance occurs when the body produces less of the enzyme lactase, which is necessary for digesting lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. This decline in lactase activity often occurs naturally with aging, leading to what is termed primary lactose intolerance, where symptoms may start in adolescence or adulthood as lactase production decreases gradually [1,2,4,11,18].\n\nSecondary lactose intolerance, on the other hand, can appear more abruptly and is typically caused by an illness, injury, or surgery affecting the small intestine, such as Crohn's disease, celiac disease, or bacterial infections. In these cases, the condition may be temporary, resolving once the underlying issue is treated [2,3,5,10]. Additionally, factors such as extreme stress or dietary changes, such as eliminating dairy for prolonged periods, might contribute to a reduction in the body's ability to digest lactose [0].\n\nThe ability of the small intestine to adapt varies significantly among individuals, depending on genetic factors, diet, and ethnic background. Some people may regain tolerance if they reintroduce lactose gradually, enabling the gut flora to adapt, while others may need to avoid lactose indefinitely [0,4,7].

It can develop gradually or suddenly, primarily due to decreased production of the enzyme \"lastace\", which is necessary for lactose digestion [1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 16]. This condition often begins in adolescence but can merge later in life as a result of intestinal injury, illness such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease, or even gastrointestinal infections [0, 1, 3, 12]. While some individuals may regain lactose tolerance through gradual dietary adjustments, many will need to permanently avid lactose to prevent symptoms like diarrhoea, gas, and bloating, which can occur within 30 minutes to 2 hours after consuming dairy [2, 7, 19].\nLactose intolerance is classified into three types: primary, secondary and congenital [4, 10, 11]. Primary lactose intolerance, the most common form, typically manifests as reduced lactase production due to ageing and can appear suddenly when symptoms become more noticeable [4]. Secondary lactase intolerance can develop abruptly due to intestinal damage from disease or infections but may be reversible with appropriate treatment [3, 4]. Congenital lactose intolerance is rare, occurring when infants are born without functional lactase leading to an inability to digest lactose from birth [4]. \nVarious factors can influence the onset of lactose intolerance, including genetic predisposition, ethnic background, and dietary habits [12]. Individuals of Asian, African and Native American descent are more likely to experience symptoms earlier in life, often as lactase production declines post-infancy [12, 13]. Furthermore, lifestyle changes, such as a prolonged elimination of dairy, can also lead to temporary lactose intolerance, which may resolve if dairy is gradually reintroduced [5, 8].\nDiagnosis of lactose intolerance involves a review of medical history, symptom assessment, and potentially a hydrogen breath test [10,18]. As individuals age, it is common for their bodies to produce less lactase, leading to natural lactose intolerance and the development of symptoms that require management through dietary strategies or lactose-free alternatives [15, 18].

Civil engineers work on essential projects that include roads, bridges, dams, and water supply systems, addressing contemporary issues like pollution and sustainability[5,6,12].\n\nEmployment opportunities for civil engineers are promising as the need for infrastructure development grows alongside the global population. This demand translates into strong job security and the potential for advancement within the field[0,2]. Civil engineers typically begin their careers working for firms, often collaborating with architects and other professionals. With experience, they may progress to more senior roles, engage in consultancy, or even start their own firms[0].\n\nThe profession not only demands a strong foundation in science and mathematics but also requires knowledge of current technologies and best practices[2]. Creativity and adaptability are crucial as civil engineers often confront complex problems and must devise innovative solutions. Their work is not only technical but also involves considering environmental, legal, and financial aspects[5,14].\n\nWhile civil engineering can involve rigorous deadlines and stress, it offers a sense of accomplishment by contributing significantly to society's infrastructure and improving the quality of life through well-designed public works[19,18].","probability":0.1033518064}

A house isn\u2019t clean until we open every closet and sweep every corner. People who truly desire to be clean are completely honest about their lives. No more secrets. Repentant people face the pain that their sins caused others. They invite the victims of their sin (anyone hurt by their actions) to express the intensity of emotions that they feel\u2014anger, hurt, sorrow, and disappointment. Repentant people do not give excuses or shift blame [3].\n\n- Even someone with a sincere determination to change won\u2019t always succeed the first time or the second. It\u2019s easy to slip back into old habits at first, sometimes without realizing it. It often helps to reconsider our strategy and explore other methods of managing triggers before trying again.

This can be a positive finding, as it indicates better quality of medical treatment for mental health conditions, which can be defined by better identification and diagnosis of mental health conditions [18,19]. While there are no results relevant to a Rapoza finding results in mental health, there are many researchers, scientists, and organizations without the name Rapoza or Baker, who have significantly contributed to the knowledge and discussions surrounding mental health.

While there is no direct causation linked between mental health issues and a shorter lifespan, there are factors that contribute to this finding, as people with poorer mental health may participate in higher-risk behavior like smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, and even suicide attempts [1,2,4,6,7].

While Centrists are pragmatic, they seek leadership from the government to hold accountability for their actions, and logic to work out solutions rather than party loyalty [12,13,15,16]. The Centrist Party believes that those in an elected office should uphold the interests of the general public and not the loyalty of a select few for the purposes of re-election [16,17,18]. Elected officials, like the president, are therefore not an exception to this rule. Considering Articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution cite specific powers the President is granted as well as the major purposes and function of the presidential position, we can interpret how Centrists may view the powers of the president [0,1,2,5,6,8,9]. Presidents hold executive power, which means they are the main leader in one of the three branches; the executive branch, the legislative branch (Congress), and the judicial branch [9]. The president has \"the power to appoint ambassadors, members of the Cabinet, Justices of the Supreme Court and Judges of the lower Federal Courts\", veto bills, create treatises with other nations, be the commander-in-chief for the armed forces, and grant reprieves and pardons [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. However, the power of the president is limited by the checks and balances in place from the other branches. For instance, even though the president can veto a bill, that veto can be overruled by 2\/3rds vote from both Houses of Congress [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10]. The treaties with foreign nations is also only permitted with the consent of 2\/3rds of the Senate [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10]. While there are checks and balances in place to limit presidential power, there could probably be more systems in place where powerful minorities can't influence the president, or more limitations on the president's ability to appoint people into power, as elected officials should be interested in the common good and not a select few according to the Centrist perspective.\n\n","probability":0.0952504784}

Regarding the powers of the president, centrists often advocate for a middle ground that ensures robust constitutional authority while preventing an overreach of executive power. This balance reflects their general preference for accountability and reasonable governance, which aligns with their belief in checks and balances as foundational to preventing any branch\u2014especially the executive\u2014from becoming too powerful [12, 17, 18].\n\nArticle II of the U.S. Constitution outlines the formal powers of the president, including executing federal laws, appointing ambassadors and Supreme Court justices, and serving as commander-in-chief of the armed forces [1, 2, 6]. While the Constitution does grant significant authority to the president, centrists emphasize the importance of the separation of powers to prevent any form of an \"imperial presidency,\" where the executive might overshadow the legislative and judicial branches [3, 5, 7]. This view underscores the necessity for legislative checks on presidential power, such as requiring Senate approval for treaties and appointments.\n\nCentrists generally support a framework where the president's actions are subject to oversight and accountability measures like impeachment if necessary. This reflects their broader concern with integrity and ethical governance [12, 17]. Ultimately, centrists favor a presidency empowered to lead effectively but restrained by constitutional mechanisms that preserve democratic governance and prevent the concentration of power [11, 13, 18].","probability":0.1099906417}

Furthermore, Centrists emphasize the need for checks and balances, asserting that the president should not wield excessive power without oversight from Congress and the judiciary [11, 15].\nMoreover, centrists argue that the president's role includes promoting bipartisanship and cooperation among political parties to foster effective governance [12]. They believe that when the president operates within a framework of shared power, it encourages constructive dialogue and diminishes the partisanship that often characterizes U.S. politics [16]. Centrists are critical of any attempts to expand presidential power at the expense of democratic institutions, viewing such actions as detrimental to the health of the political system [18].\nAdditionally, centrists advocate for reform in the political process to prevent any single individual or party from monopolizing power [19]. They are concerned about the influence of special interest groups on presidential decision-making and stress that the president should prioritize the common good over personal or party interest [13].

Initially designed to regulate indoor climates for comfort and productivity, air conditioning systems have inadvertently lowered the natural human tolerance for temperature extremes. Scientific studies support the claim that air conditioning has reduced individuals' ability to withstand high temperatures by creating an artificial, consistently cool environment, which mitigates the body's natural adaptive responses to heat [0,1].\n\nThis phenomenon emerged as societies increasingly relied on air conditioning to cope with heat, particularly in hotter regions, facilitating greater habitation and economic expansion in places like Texas, Florida, and Arizona [0]. However, constant exposure to air-conditioned environments can have adverse health effects, including weakened immunity, since the body is stressed by sudden transitions between the cool indoor air and the hot outdoor temperatures [2,3]. This adaptation process may heighten vulnerability to heat-related health problems, such as heat exhaustion during summer heat waves [4,5].\n\nAdditionally, long-term exposure to low temperatures disrupts the body's natural thermoregulatory processes. As individuals move frequently between cold and warm environments, the stress on the body can lead to fatigue, respiratory issues, and an increased risk of viral infections due to the dry and recirculated air indoors [6,12].

Critics of flat taxes argue that the system places an unfair burden on low-wage earners in exchange for lowering tax rates on the wealthy, and only believe the fairer of the two systems is regressive tax [1,5,6]. While a flat tax imposes the same tax percentage on all individuals regardless of income, many see it as a regressive tax [1].

In a regressive tax system, the tax rate decreases as the taxpayer\u2019s income increases, meaning that lower-income earners pay a higher percentage of their income compared to their wealthier counterparts. This system often results in a more significant financial burden on the poor, who must allocate a larger proportion of their limited resources to tax payments, thereby exacerbating economic inequality [0, 1, 2].\n\nCritics argue that such a taxation system is inherently unjust and inequitable because it does not align with the principle of ability to pay; those who are less able financially are forced to bear a heavier tax burden relative to their income, while wealthier individuals pay a smaller proportion [8, 19]. This discrepancy often leads to further economic disparity, as it diminishes the disposable income of lower-income individuals, potentially affecting their standard of living and hindering social mobility [2, 8, 19].\n\nMoreover, regressive taxes can be seen in specific forms such as sales taxes and \"sin taxes\" on goods like tobacco and alcohol, which disproportionately impact those with lower incomes. Although these taxes are applied uniformly, the lower-income groups sacrifice a larger share of their earnings to meet these tax obligations compared to wealthier individuals [5, 12].

It must be noted that in regressive taxation, though the total amount of tax increases on a higher income in the absolute sense, in the relative sense, the tax rate declines on a higher income [8]. \nA regressive tax is one in which the government taxes high-income earners at a lower percentage of their income and low-wage earners at a higher percentage of their income [1,3,4]. There is an inverse relationship between the tax rate and the taxpayer's ability to pay [2]. People with low income and low ability to pay, will pay higher taxes. This means that it hits lower-income individuals harder [2]. The tax is seen as regressive due to a more significant portion of the total funds available to the low-income earner going to the tax expenditure [4].

The migrations and invasions of people groups took place from the north of the continent, moving to the south, while the Europeans occupied the country from the south. The two European countries who occupied the land were the Netherlands (1652-1795 and 1803-1806) and Great Britain (1795-1803 and 1806-1961). Historians call the period between 1881 and 1914 the New Imperialism [0].\n\n- From the late 19th century through the early 20th century, European imperialism grew substantially, leading to changes in Africa. These changes included colonialism, exploitation of resources and an increase in trade. The needs driving these changes were political, economic and social. The major powers of the time, including England, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Belgium, were in competition to be the most powerful nations in Europe [5].","probability":0.4762699847}

This period of New Imperialism saw almost the entire continent colonized by European powers such as Britain, France, Germany, and Belgium, among others, except for Ethiopia and Liberia, which remained independent [4, 9, 10].\n\nDistinctively, the colonization of Africa was marked by the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, during which European nations met to establish guidelines for the annexation of African territories. This conference highlighted the European intent to avoid internal conflict, yet it disregarded African sovereignty entirely [5, 8]. Arbitrary borders drawn during this era still pose challenges for African governance today [4].\n\nThe experiences of colonization varied across the continent, reflecting diverse historical and cultural contexts. For example, South Africa's colonization uniquely involved both European occupation from the south and indigenous migrations from the north, creating a complex socio-political landscape [0, 1]. In contrast, the Eastern African region featured imperial struggles predominantly involving Germany, France, and Britain, affecting regional dynamics such as the control of slave routes and resources [3].\n\nOverall, the imperialist activities in Africa were driven by Europe's industrial needs, triggering unprecedented socio-economic and cultural transformations that continue to influence the continent's trajectory [10, 14].","probability":0.1037786914}

These things go untended, get left behind, or are negatively impacted when there is a failure to plan (budget) for them [14,12,18]. \n\nThe impact of failing to align financial behaviors with values may also be felt as increased stress and possibly increased financial difficulties that directly arise from poor financial choices [0,1,10,15,16]. Anxiety, shame, and negative relationship effects may also be on the cards if the things designated as \"values\" are not considered when we make financial choices [0,1,15,16]. These all contribute to higher levels of stress.\n\nMisalignment of values and financial behaviors can also lead to unpreparedness for unforeseen or emergency events [9,11,12]. That unpreparedness can, in turn, lead to financial shock; the necessity to borrow and become more indebted; and the stress that accompanies all of those. Research meta-analysis has unearthed a very strong correlation between debt and mental health struggles [15,16].

The emotional turmoil associated with financial mismanagement can further deteriorate mental health, as individuals experience shame, guilt, and dissatisfaction in their personal lives [0,1]. This disconnect can also cause social isolation, as financial strain often correlates with a decrease in the quality of relationships, owing to financial disputes or general dissatisfaction [0].\n\nFurthermore, the dissonance between financial behaviors and personal values can hinder personal fulfillment and empowerment. Aligning spending with genuine priorities can create a rewarding and balanced life, reducing unimportant expenses and promoting a healthy money mindset [1,2]. Conversely, ignoring this alignment may result in impulsive purchases that do not fulfill deeper values, leading to long-term financial instability and decreased happiness [10].\n\nOn a broader scale, consistently mismanaging finances or making impulsive financial decisions without aligning them with one's core values leads to larger systemic issues such as chronic debt, lack of savings, and minimal financial resilience in the face of emergencies [12,15].

Ignoring the state of finances could lead to \"heightened anxiety, shame, guilt, and relationship stress\" [1]. Some may even experience social isolation and dissatisfaction with their personal lives [1]. \"Individuals with overwhelming financial issues are also at greater risk for depression, alcohol dependency, drug dependency, psychotic issues, and suicide\" [15]. \n\nThis could also result in the inability to reach personal goals that were already set, as their behaviors allow them to get distracted by things that don't necessarily matter for long-term objectives [6].\n\nExamples of this case is buying expensive goods to keep up appearances on social media, instead of saving to purchase their first home. When their behaviors don't align with their core values, people tend to go for things that can quickly satisfy them, instead of focusing on  long-term goals. \n\nThat's why the first step to aligning values with financial behavior is to set a goal [8]. Create priorities that \"align with your personal values\" where \"the largest categories should reflect what matters most\" [9]. For example, a person's priority might be to travel more if they value adventures and learning other cultures, while another is to save for their first home [9].\n\nAfterward, create budget to minimize the effects of external influences [9]. By spending what the budget entails, there's less chances of succumbing into society pressures and more possibility of long-term success.  \n\nAnother way to counteract this is by creating a routine [19].

They carried their political aspirations to America, where they formed a significant voting block, and introduced political ideologies such as anarchism and socialism to their new communities [3,4]. No other immigrant group founded so many different societies: there were specific occupational groups, shooting clubs, singing groups, literary associations, and gymnastic clubs, as well as societies for Germans from particular regions, to name just a few [5]. \nDuring the 1840s & 1850s German immigrants were an important subset of American culture from before the Revolution, but they made their greatest impact beginning in the 1840s and 1850s, when over a million migrated to the U.S., primarily to escape political upheaval [3,4]. The German immigrants were not moving to America and adopting the ways of the English speaking community [0]. The German immigrants moved to America and brought with them the German language and the German way of doing things [0].

Among the most notable was the establishment of communities that reflected German culture in language, customs, and education. German immigrants founded schools with a strong emphasis on early public education, notably introducing the kindergarten system to America in 1857, an initiative started by Margaretha Meyer Schurz in Wisconsin[1,7]. They also maintained German-language newspapers, clubs, and organizations that served as cultural hubs within their communities[1,5].\n\nRecreational practices were another noteworthy contribution, with Germans popularizing organized Sunday outings, which led to the development of recreational facilities such as picnic grounds and bowling alleys in American towns[6,7]. These activities reflected a broader German enthusiasm for communal socializing, evidenced by singing societies, theater groups, and sports clubs[5].\n\nCulinary traditions were also preserved and widely adopted by Americans. German contributions to American cuisine include the popularity of sausages, sauerkraut, and particularly beer, with the latter significantly influenced by German brewers like the Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association[1,19]. Additionally, German Christmas customs, including the Christmas tree, became integrated into the American holiday tradition[1,6].\n\nOverall, German immigrants forged lasting influences not just through the maintenance of their cultural identity but also by introducing distinctive practices and traditions that have become embedded in the broader tapestry of American culture[0,1,5]. These cultural practices continue to echo in present-day American society, showcasing the depth and breadth of German contributions to America.","probability":0.100936158}

A pivotal moment was China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, which significantly boosted its export manufacturing sector and accelerated economic reforms aimed at enhancing industrialization and global trade engagement [2,7]. This move, supported by U.S. diplomatic efforts, allowed China to leverage its competitive labor costs and become an integral part of the global manufacturing supply chain, contributing to its rapid emergence as the \"world's factory\" [5,7].\n\nAdditionally, U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) policies have encouraged substantial American investments in China, aiding the development of China's industrial and technological sectors. U.S. companies invested $105 billion in China in 2019 alone, underscoring the significant capital flows that have bolstered Chinese growth [0,1]. The integration into global supply chains, facilitated by trade and investment, has allowed Chinese firms to improve their productivity and innovation capabilities, thereby enhancing their competitiveness on the global stage [1,3].\n\nDespite the benefits from these policies, the resulting trade deficit with China has stirred controversies and debates among U.S. policymakers. Concerns about unfair trade practices, including intellectual property theft and the imposition of tariffs, have highlighted ongoing challenges in the U.S.-China trade relationship [6,12].

On one hand, such an expansion, as seen during the enactment of the CARES Act, can provide financial relief to unemployed workers, thereby mitigating the immediate effects of economic downturns and stimulating consumer spending. The increase in disposable income for beneficiaries often results in higher demand for goods and services, which can in turn support employment levels and drive economic growth [8]. \n\nMoreover, expanded benefits can also help sustain household spending levels, which is crucial for economic stability. For example, the Congressional Budget Office projected that extended unemployment benefits could result in greater U.S. economic output in the short term, as they help maintain spending on essential goods [7]. During recessions, unemployment benefits are thus pivotal in supporting aggregate demand.\n\nConversely, expanded benefits can have potential drawbacks. Critics argue that generous unemployment benefits may disincentivize workforce reentry, as recipients may earn more from benefits than from employment, thus weakening labor supply incentives [2,7]. This concern is compounded by the program's impact on federal budgets, which could lead to increased deficits over time if not carefully managed [9].\n\nIn conclusion, while expanded unemployment benefits can play a critical role in economic recovery and provide essential relief to individuals, they must be designed carefully to balance immediate fiscal assistance with long-term economic incentives and sustainability.

Historically, fewer than 30% of unemployed workers qualified for benefits, making this expansion crucial in providing adequate support during economic downturns [1].\nThe additional $600 per week for unemployed individuals sparked controversy over potential disincentives to return to work, prompting proposals for reduced benefits or incentives like \"Back to Work Bonuses\" [2, 3].

The primary intent behind such expansions, which included an additional $600 weekly federal payment, was to provide immediate financial relief to the unemployed during economic crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This move effectively elevated the unemployment insurance (UI) payouts in some cases above the wages workers were earning, raising concerns about potential disincentives to return to work [2,3,9].\n\nCritics argue that when unemployment benefits exceed potential earnings, the incentive to seek employment diminishes, potentially prolonging unemployment rates and affecting labor force participation [3,7,19].

This perspective suggests that such benefits function as a critical lifeline, preventing further economic downturn by maintaining consumer demand [6,7].\n\nBackground information highlights that these benefits are federally funded and tailored to adapt during economic turmoil, demonstrating varying state-to-state effects due to differing eligibility criteria [0,1].

The party opposes any governmental interference or legislative efforts aimed at undermining this right, viewing abortion as a deeply personal decision involving a woman, her family, her doctor, and her clergy [0, 1, 4].\n\nIn recent years, Democrats have actively sought to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which restricts the use of federal funds for abortion services, and to restore funding to organizations like Planned Parenthood, which provides reproductive health services [3, 6]. While the party is committed to safeguarding abortion rights, it also advocates for measures to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies through comprehensive sex education and the promotion of contraceptive use [0, 5].\n\nHistorically, Democrats have sought to make abortions \"safe, legal, and rare,\" a phrase popularized by former President Clinton. This reflects a broader vision of balancing the right to choose with public health initiatives aimed at improving reproductive services and reducing the need for abortions [6].

Central to this interaction is the role of cortisol, a stress hormone that influences various brain areas responsible for memory [0,1,2,4]. Chronic stress, characterized by prolonged exposure to elevated cortisol levels, has been linked to reductions in hippocampal volume. This reduction is particularly detrimental because the hippocampus is critical for hippocampal-dependent memory functions, including declarative, episodic, spatial, and contextual memory [0,1,2]. Such effects have been observed in various conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Cushing's disease, where individuals exhibit smaller hippocampal sizes and impaired memory [2].\n\nAcute stress also poses immediate challenges to cognitive processes by impairing short-term and working memory.

As people congregated in urban centers to work in factories, there was a significant shift towards individualism, disrupting the tight-knit rural communities that had previously defined much of society [0,1,2]. \n\nThe factory system's impact extended to social class dynamics, as it exacerbated inequalities. Factory owners amassed considerable wealth, while workers, often subjected to grueling working hours and conditions, remained underpaid, widening the class divide [0,1,5]. Moreover, the nature of work itself was revolutionized, replacing the domestic system where work was integrated with family life, to a more rigid structure with set hours under a singular authority [7].\n\nFactories employed men, women, and children, often exploiting their labor due to their willingness to work for lower wages compared to men, until reforms such as child labor laws eventually curbed these practices [0,3,5]. The introduction of mass production via mechanization also led to the decline in demand for skilled craftspeople, altering traditional labor dynamics [5,7].\n\nOverall, the factory system was a catalyst for modern urbanization and economic models, creating both opportunities and challenges in society. It promoted economic growth and industrialization but also raised significant socio-economic issues that influenced labor reforms and urban planning in subsequent years.","probability":0.0707608781}

Delayed grieving is when we hold in grief instead of expressing and working through it [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9].  \n\nDelayed grieving may lead to a wide array of biological or physical consequences that increase in number and severity as time goes by [0,1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10,11]. Over the years, many studies have looked at the biological effects of grief with some focussing on the effects of delayed grief [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19]. These effects include, but are not limited to, headaches; gastrointestinal issues, such as ulcers, constipation, and diarrhea; low back pain; rheumatoid arthritis; fibromyalgia; muscle tightness; asthma; high blood pressure, and even cancers [0,1,2,3,5,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,]. \n\nThe range of adverse biological effects of holding in grief is thought to originate from the chronic (long-term) stress the body is subjected to while the grieving process is delayed [8,9,10,13,14,15,16,17]. That stress causes the release of hormones and other chemicals that may have served the body well as an immediate reaction to the loss but which, in the long term, begins negatively affecting body systems [10,13,14,17,18,19].

The emotional strain associated with suppressed grief is known to inflate cortisol levels, resulting in chronic inflammation and stress [13].\n\nMoreover, the interplay between emotional and physical distress is significant. Emotional stress from unresolved grief can tap into the body's fight-or-flight mechanisms, leading to intensified sympathetic nervous system activity which can, over time, result in detrimental changes in genetic expression and immune functioning [10,15]. This can also lead to increased vulnerability to infections and inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and asthma [16,17].\n\nThe psychological impact is no less concerning. Unprocessed grief may bring about depression, anxiety, and feelings of numbness or lack of appetite [1,3]. These psychological disturbances are compounded by the physiological symptoms, reinforcing a cycle of distress that complicates the healing process [2,4].\n\nIn conclusion, holding in grief creates a complex web of biological reactions that can deteriorate one's health over time.

Genes are the linear sequence of the nucleotides that are mainly encoded for a protein having a particular function. The alleles are defined as the variant type of the gene. These alleles are responsible for transmitting characteristics from one generation to another. The hereditary diseases are uncontrollable because they occur due to the mutation in the allele and they are transferred from one generation to another. Due to which it cannot be altered with any medical treatment. Some diseases can be controlled, such as cold and STIs. Children have very similar gene structures to their parents, so traits, appearance, and diseases are often passed from parents to children [0,7]. \n\n- There are thousands of genes on the pair of chromosomes, X and Y, and each gene carries a trait. Usually genes carry normal traits but sometimes due to reasons unknown, the genes get altered resulting in a \u2018mutant\u2019 gene. The offspring inherits a copy of gene from each parent and if either one or both the copies of gene are mutated, then the offspring is at a risk of getting an inherited disease [1]. \n\n- Mutation is the term used for a spontaneous change in a chromosome or gene. Normally chromosomes duplicate themselves exactly during cell division. Occasionally, however, the new cells contain an altered gene or chromosome. If the mutation occurs in an ovum or sperm involved in reproduction, the new trait will be expressed in the offspring [3].\n\n- Hereditary diseases should be distinguished from congenital birth defects. A congenital defect is one that the infant is born with, such as a cleft lip, a birthmark, or congenital syphilis, but the defect can arise during conception or pregnancy and not be related to heredity [3].","probability":0.2640958429}

These mutations can lead to hereditary diseases if they are present in reproductive cells (sperm or egg) [3,13].\n- There are two main patterns of inheritance for hereditary diseases: dominant and recessive. Dominant inheritance occurs when a single copy of a mutated gene from one parent is sufficient to cause the disease. In contrast, recessive inheritance requires both copies of a gene to be mutated, usually necessitating both parents to be carriers of the mutation [11,16,18].\n- Many individuals with a mutated gene may not display symptoms themselves but can be carriers, passing the genetic mutation to their children [5,16].\n- Examples of hereditary diseases include cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and hemophilia.

The transmission involves complex genetic mechanisms primarily dependent on the type of inheritance pattern: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked[1,3,16].\n\nIn autosomal dominant inheritance, a single altered gene inherited from one parent can cause the disease, with each offspring having a 50% chance of inheriting the mutant gene[16]. Diseases such as Huntington's disease follow this pattern. In contrast, autosomal recessive inheritance requires the inheritance of two defective genes, one from each parent. Consequently, if both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance that their child will manifest the disease, such as cystic fibrosis[4,11,18]. Conversely, X-linked disorders, such as hemophilia, predominantly affect males, as they inherit an altered gene on the X chromosome from their mothers, who are typically carriers[19].\n\nMutations, spontaneous changes in DNA, play a crucial role, often resulting in hereditary diseases when these mutations occur in germ cells (sperm or egg) and are passed to offspring[3,4]. Hereditary diseases differ from congenital disorders, which may arise during fetal development and are not inherited[3]. While some genetic abnormalities cause overt diseases, many individuals may remain asymptomatic carriers, unknowingly transmitting defective genes[10].

These diseases can be inherited in various ways, primarily through defective genes located on chromosomes, which transmit traits from parents to offspring [1, 2, 10]. If either or both copies of a gene are mutated, the child may inherit the disease even if the parents do not exhibit symptoms, making it possible for carriers to unknowingly pass on these genetic conditions [4, 5]. The risk of developing a genetic disease increases significantly when both parents carry dysfunctional genes, as seen in conditions like cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease, which require the transmission of mutated alleles from both parents for the disease to manifest in their offspring [18, 19]. Genetic disorders can be classified into two main inheritance patterns: autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive. In autosomal dominant inheritance, a child has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease if one parent carries the mutated gene [11]. Conversely, autosomal recessive disorders require that both parents carry and pass on the mutated gene for the disease to appear in their child, resulting in a 25% chance of a child being affected and a 50% chance of being a carrier without symptoms [16, 18]. Mutations in one or more genes can lead to monogenic disorders, which stem from a single mutated gene, or multifactorial disorders, influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors [6, 10].\nUnderstanding hereditary diseases is crucial for identifying risks and taking preventative measures, especially given that many hereditary conditions can be traced through family history [8, 9]. While hereditary diseases often arise from gene mutations that have been passed down, some genetic disorders may develop spontaneously and not be inherited [15]. Common examples of hereditary diseases include haemophilia, sickle cell anaemia, and hereditary cancers, which underscore the importance of genetic factors in disease manifestation [13, 19]. As genetic understanding progresses, awareness of how these diseases are transmitted continues to be essential for effective prevention and management strategies.","probability":0.1713010984}

Such conditions are frequently familial, affecting multiple generations within a lineage [0,1,2,4].\n\nThere are two primary patterns of genetic inheritance: autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive. In dominant inheritance, only one mutated gene from an affected parent is needed for the disease to manifest in the offspring, offering a 50% chance of transmission with each pregnancy.

This process of exclusion is not merely incidental but is often woven into the very fabric of societal operations.\n\nIn many instances, those in power manipulate educational, economic, and legal systems to favor their interests while disenfranchising others.

The Vietnam War was devastating for the U.S. economy and one of the reasons behind it was the strain on the nation\u2019s production capacity. The war led to a shift from consumer goods to military equipment production, which hurt consumer spending and overall economic growth [1,2]. Staggering military spending created significant budget deficits, weakened the dollar, and skyrocketed inflation rates. All this further disrupted the economy and also played a key role in reducing the government\u2019s credibility and fanning an anti-war sentiment throughout the country. [1]\nIn 1968, military spending peaked at 9.5% of GDP and exacerbated these economic pressures [11]. The war's demands, combined with domestic spending on President Johnson's \"Great Society\" programs, fueled inflation and eroded consumer confidence [3,4]. This inflationary environment was particularly severe and the government did \u201ctoo little and too late\u201d by introducing a 10% income tax surcharge and even that was affected by political maneuvering [0]. All this led to increased interest rates, reduced capital availability, and ultimately a slowdown in economic growth [0,3,5].\nOverall, the war's economic strain shifted the U.S. from the prosperity of the early 1960s to the economic crises of the 1970s, and 1968 was a pivotal year for that shift [4,7].\n","probability":0.08939634}

The financial burden was significant, with military expenditure reaching $26.5 billion in 1968, representing 9.5% of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the highest during the war years [0, 11, 13]. This extensive military spending, coupled with President Lyndon B. Johnson's refusal to finance the war through increased taxation, led to soaring federal deficits and precipitated a cycle of inflation [4, 0]. The fiscal demands of simultaneously financing the war and Johnson\u2019s expansive domestic initiatives, known as the Great Society programs, further strained the economy [6, 18].\n\nIndustrial shifts worsened the economic impact, as factories pivoted from producing consumer goods to military supplies, detracting from consumer market activity and contributing to a weaker balance of trade [1, 2]. This shift also exacerbated the U.S. dollar's depreciation and prompted international monetary challenges, notably affecting U.S. gold reserves [0, 9].\n\nPublic dissatisfaction over government policy during this period led to a decline in consumer confidence, further suppressing economic growth [3]. The eventual introduction of a 10% income tax surcharge in 1969 aimed to mitigate fiscal damage; however, it was deemed insufficient by many economists as it slowed down economic recovery without adequately addressing deficits [0, 13].\n\nOverall, the Vietnam War precipitated a series of adverse economic events in 1968, characterized by runaway inflation, increased national debt, and a substantial weakening of industrial productivity and fiscal stability. These conditions helped set the stage for the broader economic crises that beset the U.S. throughout the 1970s [0, 3, 4].","probability":0.0966875801}

The war required enormous military expenditures, peaking at 9.5% of GDP in 1968, at a significant cost to the federal budget and displacing scarce resources away from domestic programs. At the same time, funding the war and Johnson's \"Great Society\" programs without raising taxes increased federal deficits and inflation[7,13].\n\nThe industrial shift put additional strain on the economy. Factories continued to increase the production of war instruments and reduced the manufacturing of civilian goods. This was a natural consequence as a result of all these factors, combined with the increasing government debt, which made the balance of payments derailed and a weak dollar weathered heavy pressure in international markets [2,4,8]. In addition, an international monetary crisis occurred during 1967-68 for the U.S. because of the expansion of concern in the gold reserves situation, caused by a trade imbalance [6].\n\nConsumer confidence was unfavorably affected and saving was discouraged by the subsequent galloping inflation during this period. Economic growth yet again came to a stalemate when Congress, in 1968, approved a tax hike along with cuts in domestic spending [13,16]. It then entered into a recession, which became even more entrenched in its state, with chronic inflation and budgetary constraints stretching into the following decade.\n\nThe economic consequences of the war also set a long-term trend, such as the reduction of U.S. interventionism in the world as well as the beginning of a volunteer military, all of which indicated a new way of thinking both in economic policy and military strategy [4,5]. \n\n","probability":0.0545306216}

A good fit supports psychological and social development, whereas a poor fit might lead to negative self-perceptions in the child [18].\n- Encouraging self-actualization, where individuals strive to fulfill their potential, is another critical component in achieving high congruence. Supporting their children's pursuit of personal goals and values without imposing external expectations can aid in this process [6,10,17].","probability":0.1811907809}

They made progress in agriculture despite having to adapt to a new culture [19]. Harsh environmental problems, economic difficulties, and discriminating socio-political pressures such as the anti-alien laws (see California Alien Land Law of 1913) were further obstacles [2,19].

Their achievements are particularly evident in the agricultural sector. Japanese American farmers revolutionized farming practices on the West Coast by introducing labor-intensive and high-yield agricultural techniques. This allowed them to dominate the production of various crops, such as strawberries, artichokes, and snap beans, even though they controlled less than four percent of California's farmland by 1940[0,1,9]. \n\nDespite facing significant barriers, including discriminatory laws such as the California Alien Land Law of 1913, Japanese immigrants were able to excel by leveraging their advanced agricultural knowledge and cooperative spirit. These legal restrictions prevented them from owning land, yet many became successful tenant farmers, contributing as much as 35% of the value of commercial truck crops in California by 1941[2,5]. The adverse conditions of internment during World War II substantially affected their agricultural activities, but Japanese Americans persisted in their contributions to American agriculture even after these restrictions were lifted[1,7].\n\nOutside agriculture, Japanese Americans also proved their resilience and loyalty. Many Nisei served with distinction in the U.S. military during World War II, notably in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a unit that became highly decorated despite facing widespread discrimination[12,13].

For instance, congressional priorities are frequently occupied by pressing issues such as economic stimulus, healthcare, or defense budgets, sidelining comprehensive crypto legislation [0,1,9].\n\n- The existing regulatory framework is fragmented and lacks clarity. Multiple bills like the Cryptocurrency Act of 2020 and the Digital Commodity Exchange Act propose different approaches to regulating crypto assets, but this multiplicity can slow the legislative process by creating confusion and opposition among policymakers [6,8,17].\n\n- There exists an inherent conflict between regulatory bodies such as the SEC, CFTC, and FinCEN, each with differing views on how digital assets should be classified and regulated. This divergence impedes the creation of a unified regulatory framework necessary for a comprehensive bill [5,6,17].\n\n- Strong resistance from parts of the financial sector and concerns over stifling innovation contribute to legislative inertia. The financial industry and pro-crypto advocates argue that stringent regulations may hamper technological advancement and deter investment in blockchain innovations [16,17].\n\n- The legislative discussion often stalls in response to uncertainties about how to align new technologies with existing financial and privacy laws. The complexity and evolving nature of cryptocurrency increase the challenge for legislators to create laws that are both comprehensive and adaptable to future developments [15,18].","probability":0.0741902447}

The U.S. government has often been preoccupied with high-stakes issues unrelated to digital assets, such as significant tax reforms or healthcare policy, diverting attention away from the complex task of crypto regulation [1, 2]. Moreover, the legislative inertia in addressing technological advances like cryptocurrency reflects a historical lag in adapting existing legal frameworks to new market innovations [15].\n\nThere is also significant resistance from both political and business communities to sweeping regulatory changes that could stifle innovation or impact the nascent digital asset market adversely [3, 14]. Regulatory clarity is demanded by many stakeholders yet achieving consensus on the specifics of such regulation remains elusive.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are fragmented legislative initiatives aiming to regulate cryptocurrencies, the confluence of political distractions, existing legislative gridlock, and resistance to change means a comprehensive crypto bill is unlikely to pass in the near future.

These activities often require undressing, which can create opportunities for predators to push physical boundaries and initiate inappropriate contact under the guise of innocent activities, such as drying off a child or helping them change clothes [1, 2]. Moreover, the physical environment of water-related activities can obscure visibility, making it easier for abusers to engage in covert behavior without detection [2].\nWater activities also require a certain level of trust and leave the victims even more vulnerable both physically and emotionally. Pools and other water bodies also disrupt the natural lubrication of the body, increasing the risk of vaginal abrasions during forced sexual contact. In such situations, the lack of natural lubrication, exacerbated by water exposure, can lead to painful abrasions, further complicating the physical trauma experienced by victims [0, 5, 16]. This disruption of natural lubrication, combined with the friction caused by forced sexual activities, can significantly increase the risk of injuries, making water-based environments particularly dangerous in the context of sexual abuse [0, 13, 16].\nOverall, the combination of reduced visibility, the requirement for undressing, and the physiological impacts of water on the body creates a perfect storm where sexual abuse can more easily occur and go undetected [1, 2, 5, 13].","probability":0.1024290049}

Water-based activities often require participants to remove clothing, creating situations that may ease inappropriate contact. This aspect is part of a broader pattern of behavior known as sexual grooming, where abusers first establish physical boundaries before escalating to more invasive contact. The semblance of normalcy in engaging in activities such as swimming can mask inappropriate behavior, making it difficult for victims to recognize or resist assaults that may occur under the guise of play or sport [1,2,4].\n\nFurthermore, water environments can provide concealment. For instance, sexual activity in bodies of water like pools or the ocean is less visible, offering opportunities for clandestine abuse [6]. Secrecy is an essential element of the manipulative tactics used by perpetrators, including encouraging victims to keep the occurrences confidential under the guise of special treatment or relationship [1].\n\nSuch environments can also contribute to misconceptions about safety since they seem to be protected due to the presence of other observers. However, the reality is that activities in water enable and increase risk due to their intimate nature and the potential for undetected inappropriate interaction [1,2]. Therefore, vigilance and protective measures are crucial in such settings to safeguard against these inherent risks of abuse.","probability":0.0579040955}

They may push physical boundaries, wanting to give hugs, or leting the kids sit in their lap, or tickling the kid [1]. The perpetrator might also encourage activities that require undressing like going swimming or shopping [1]. Once the abuser begins to sexualize the relationship, things can become very confusing for the child [1]. A child may struggle with not wanting sexual contact, but finding their body responds to sexual stimulation in a way that \u201cfeels good [1]. Once a sexual relationship has been established, the perpetrator will often use secrecy and blame to guarantee continual participation and silence from the child or adolescent [1]. \nUnderstanding sexual grooming and pinpointing when it occurs is important from a psychological or sociological perspective to prevent sexual abuse [2]. Its precise definition and scope is equally important from a legal perspective [2]. Activities that involve removing clothes (massage, swimming), wrestling in underwear, playing games that include touching genitalia (playing doctor), telling a child sexually explicit jokes, teasing a child about breast and genital development, discussing sexually explicit information under the guise of education, showing the child sexually explicit images, taking pictures of children in underwear, bathing suits, dance wear, etc. should be avoided [2,3,4]. Ultimately, the goal of sexual grooming is to provide the perpetrator the opportunity to offend against the child without detection [4].\nSexual grooming techniques confuse children as they believe the person to be a friend or parent-like figure and thus they may fear that if they report the abuse, their special relationship may end [4].

Furthermore, the playful or relaxed atmosphere associated with such activities may lead to individuals lowering their guard, making them more vulnerable to potential abuse [4].\n\nAdditionally, adverse physical effects linked to sexual activities in water can also be concerning. The absence of sufficient lubrication when in contact with water can lead to increased friction, which can cause micro-abrasions and increase the susceptibility to infections or sexually transmitted diseases [12,13]. Such physical discomfort can make it challenging for victims to recognize and report the assault, further complicating the dynamics of sexual abuse reporting in these settings.\n\nUnderstanding these risks is crucial in developing preventive measures and awareness campaigns aimed at reducing the incidence of sexual abuse in aquatic environments by educating both individuals and caregivers about the potential dangers and signs of grooming behaviors [4,2].","probability":0.0739494225}

Eastern states like Kentucky and West Virginia exhibit some of the highest cancer rates, primarily attributed to lung cancer, which strongly correlates with smoking prevalence. Historical dependence on tobacco production in states like Kentucky has contributed to higher smoking rates compared to the national average, thus elevating the risk of lung cancer and other smoking-related cancers [0,1,3].\n\nFurthermore, obesity, a high-risk factor for various cancers, is prevalent in many of these states. Data shows that several states with obesity rates above 30% overlap with those recording high cancer incidences. This factor, combined with poor access to healthcare and preventive measures, exacerbates cancer risks in low socioeconomic regions, often dubbed the \"cancer belt\" in the southern and eastern U.S. [1,9,11].\n\nSocioeconomic factors are also critical, as lower-income states typically have less investment in healthcare infrastructure, including cancer screening and prevention programs. This lack of resources results in later-stage cancer diagnoses and higher mortality rates [8,11]. Exposure to environmental carcinogens, particularly in regions like the Appalachian Mountains, also contributes to the higher incidence of certain types of cancer [0,1].\n\nOverall, the East Coast's higher cancer rates are a complex interplay of lifestyle choices, environmental exposures, and healthcare disparities that necessitate comprehensive public health interventions to address these multifaceted challenges.","probability":0.1306595391}

Although specific studies on this apparent seasonal trend are limited, insights can be drawn from existing literature on prison suicides and the conditions that may induce suicidal behaviors within incarceration facilities.\n\nFirst, the emotional stresses of incarceration are severe and manifold. The prison environment is inherently stressful, marked by fear, a loss of control, and isolation from family and society. Such conditions can heighten inmates' feelings of hopelessness and despair, potentially contributing to suicidal ideations[4,5,7]. Importantly, exposure to solitary confinement is particularly harmful, with a higher incidence of suicides reported among those held in isolation[3]. Furthermore, the psychological toll of pending court dates, which are often associated with heightened anxiety and stress, suggests that suicides may peak when legal processes intensify during these months[0,17,19].\n\nMoreover, the influence of external and environmental factors like temperature and lack of purposeful activities during these summer months could also exacerbate mental health struggles, though these are less well-documented in the references[17]. Finally, summer may coincide with staffing shortages in correctional facilities due to vacations, which could mean less vigilance and support for at-risk inmates.\n\nIn conclusion, while the rise in suicides from July to September is not explicitly explained in current studies, it is plausible that a combination of psychological, environmental, and procedural factors contribute to this troubling trend. Ongoing research and tailored interventions remain essential for addressing and mitigating these risks within the correctional system.","probability":0.0655540554}

Most suicides take place soon after incarceration, with heightened risks during the first 24 hours and within the initial for months, as inmates face overwhelming, stress, fear, and hopelessness compounded by factors like mental illness and substance abuse issues [0, 6, 7, 8, 19].\nthe psychological distress experienced by inmates is exacerbated during high-risk periods, particularly after significant events such as court hearings or visits where distressing news may be received [0]. Isolation further intensifies these feelings, as over one-third of suicides occur in solitary confinement, where psychological stress is significantly heightened [3, 18]. Inmates often feel a lack of control and fear, which is particularly acute in maximum security facilities during periods of overcrowding and violence, contributing to elevated suicide rates [10, 11, 12].\nEffective suicide risk management is crucial, yet inadequate communication and inconsistent screening processes increase vulnerability, especially among first-time offenders [5,12]. Additionally, the summer months may coincide with changes in inmate routines, exacerbating feelings of isolation and hopelessness as inmates struggle with adjustment issues during this time [17].\nAlthough the overall suicide rate in prisons has declined, the absolute number of suicides may rise alongside the increasing inmate population [15, 16]. Larger facilities tend to report lower suicide rates, while smaller jails show significant vulnerabilities due to their concentrated populations of violent offenders [13, 14]. With nearly one-quarter of suicides occurring within the first 24 hours and over half within the first four months, the need for effective intervention and support systems remains critical, particularly during the July to September period when these vulnerabilities may peak [19].","probability":0.0731169852}

While detailed statistical data specific to these months is limited, the literature suggests certain seasonal and environmental aspects may play a role. Summer months traditionally witness a range of emotional and psychological stressors that may exacerbate mental health issues among inmates. The heat and overcrowded conditions in many facilities contribute to increased agitation and discomfort, potentially triggering depressive states or worsening existing psychiatric issues [2].\n\nMoreover, important milestones or dates such as upcoming court hearings that result in distressing news, or anniversaries of incarceration, are frequent triggers for suicidal behavior. The stress of awaiting trial or sentencing, often coupled with isolation from family and societal supports, accumulates over time, reaching potentially dangerous levels during these months [0, 3]. Psychological distress from the expectation of these events can amplify feelings of hopelessness among inmates [1, 4].\n\nResearch indicates that the prison environment itself is conducive to increased depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation due to factors such as isolation, lack of mental health resources, and the overall dehumanizing nature of incarceration [3, 6]. Enhanced training for correctional staff, improvements in the monitoring and identification of vulnerable inmates during these high-risk months, and systematic review of suicide prevention protocols are recommended steps for reducing these incidents [0, 3].","probability":0.0610745987}

These trade-offs arise due to constraints in resources, organizational capabilities, and strategic directions. The necessity to make trade-offs ensures that businesses can maintain a coherent strategy by clarifying what they choose not to pursue, thus establishing a clear competitive position. This concept is heavily emphasized by Michael Porter, who describes strategy as fundamentally about choosing what not to do, highlighting that competing businesses must make clear decisions on where to allocate resources, which inevitably leads to trade-offs [0, 1, 2].\n\nThe importance of trade-offs in business strategy is further underscored by the need to avoid confusion within the organization.

By making clear trade-offs, companies can focus their efforts on activities that create the most value for their target customers [1]. This establishes a sustainable competitive advantage [1]. For instance, Porter emphasizes that a strategic position is not sustainable unless it involves trade-offs that differentiate a company from its competitors [2, 3, 19]. This is because no single approach can meet all customer needs simultaneously [19] This principle is evident in companies like IKEA, which deliberately chooses to limit its offerings to maintain a low-cost structure while delivering functional design [6, 7].\nUnderstanding Trade-offs allows businesses to balance competing demands effectively, such as cost versus quality. In supply chain management, for example, an overemphasis on service can lead to excess inventory and increased costs, while focusing solely on cost can compromise quality and customer satisfaction [13]. Making these trade-offs explicit enables organizations to communicate clearly about objectives and expectations across departments, ensuring that different business functions align their goals and efforts [18]. This alignment is essential for navigating complex decisions that involve limited resources and high stakes, making it vital for overall operational effectiveness. \nObserved by looking at more details, that trade-offs are integral to making informed strategic decisions that consider both short-term and long-term impacts [5].

It is almost impossible to duplicate results obtained from descriptive investigations because they are based only on observations made at a single point in time. The results may vary at a different time [0]. Descriptive research entails the study of phenomena to answer the questions of what, when, where, and how [4,9]. However, they are often inadequate in helping researchers identify the cause of the phenomena [4]. Description investigation works to describe the phenomena in their natural environment without changing the variables [5]. Most of these studies have an observational nature [5,8]. The same researcher may have a different perspective if the investigation were carried out on a separate occasion. \nFor example, researchers apply interpretive models to texts such as poems or novels in literary studies. A literary researcher can apply a wide variety of interpretive models and a single interpretive model in multiple ways to various texts [12]. Using methods such as case studies might not represent the whole target sample, affecting the results produced [4]. Because no variables are manipulated, there is no way to analyze the results statistically [7]. Therefore, descriptive research methods are unsuitable for determining cause-and-effect relationships [10]. Critics of this form of research describe it as being subjective since it deals with studies of phenomena from the researcher's perspective. Results are not very reliable as it is impossible to replicate the exact procedures of the original research.","probability":0.0763715215}

Unlike experimental research, descriptive investigations do not manipulate variables or establish control groups. Instead, they aim to capture and document occurrences as they naturally unfold, often leading to varied results if repeated under different conditions or at different times [0, 2, 5]. Because these studies often lack a hypothesis or experimental controls, the reproducibility and statistical verification of results are limited. Any attempt at replication would involve observing entirely new instances under potentially altered circumstances, resulting in different outcomes [1, 4, 5].\n\nFurther complicating the repeatability of descriptive investigations is the observational nature, which can introduce subjective biases. Researchers' interpretations during data collection may vary, reflecting personal perspectives rather than standardized measures [5, 6]. Descriptive investigations commonly use qualitative methods like case studies and surveys, which do not incorporate statistical analysis to verify findings, thus influencing the reliability and generalizability of results [5, 6, 8]. Since conditions are not controlled, numerous external factors can alter the observations, making it difficult for another researcher to achieve identical results [0, 7].\n\nIn conclusion, the non-repeatability of descriptive investigations stems from their reliance on temporal observations, lack of hypothesis-driven frameworks, and potential for subjective interpretation. While such studies offer insights into specific phenomena, they face limitations in terms of reproducibility and validation, which are crucial for scientific rigor [5, 6, 9].","probability":0.0838838667}

The ease of access provided by the app, where trending videos appear immediately and require minimal effort from users, also exacerbates this addiction [5, 6]. The short video format, often ranging from 15 to 60 seconds, allows users to consume large amounts of content swiftly, which plays into the addictive cycle by providing rapid and frequent dopamine hits associated with new and varied content [9, 13].\n\nThe desire to participate in trends and gain social validation by increasing followers or becoming a TikTok star incentivizes users to spend more time on the platform. This competitive aspect, where users seek to go viral or gain likes and followers, further encourages sustained engagement and addiction [0, 16]. Consequently, TikTok trends are a central factor contributing to the app's addictiveness, compelling users to dedicate significant amounts of time to the platform to remain part of the trending culture.","probability":0.1124381035}

Moreover, notable personalities like Ida Tarbell critiqued feminism for encouraging women to pursue ambitions outside the home, which she believed led to a betrayal of traditional domestic roles, despite her own achievements contradicting such criticism [3,4].\n\nAdditionally, some have opined that feminism has led to a societal backlash that has stigmatized feminists as \"man-haters\" or has improperly focused on career and independence at the expense of family life [5,14].

The famous double slit experiment is evidence that an observer makes a difference in the behaviour of a particle or photon while being observed [0]. For example, this may not happen as objective and subjective reality in the human universe. Still, in the quantum world, the observer affects the particle's nature, which behaves either as a wave or as a particle with a definite position [1]. It is the placement of an observer or measuring instrument that defines when something will behave as a wave and when it will behave as a particle [2]. The presence of an observer makes the difference because it doesn't merely observe reality but it creates it [2, 3]. It means that even if something cannot be observed, doesn't mean it doesn't exist [3]. The presence of an observer also tells that unless no conscious observer is observing it, the things will behave in the quantum world and follow the quantum world's law. As soon as the observer with consciousness arrives, it stops following the quantum laws and starts following the real-world laws of space and time [4,5]. The famous double slit experiment is clear evidence to support this claim of the relationship between the particle and observer [5]. The famous co-manifesting statement \"When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change\" is truly acceptable based on this observer-particle relationship in quantum physics [6]. Physicists have found that even passive observation can change the results [8]. Hence the presence of an observer affects the outcome as said by Thomas DeMichele in 2015 [10].

This concept is encapsulated in what is known as the \"observer effect,\" which suggests that the mere act of observing a quantum system can alter its state. This phenomenon is vividly demonstrated in the double-slit experiment. When measuring which path a photon takes, the photon behaves as a particle and the wave-like interference pattern vanishes, indicating that the act of measurement affects the outcome [0,7].\n\nThe observer effect highlights that quantum entities exist in a superposition of states\u2014both particle-like and wave-like\u2014until measured, at which point the wave function collapses into one of the possible states. This collapse is what causes the measured outcome to appear determinate, creating an apparent influence of the observer on the physical system [1,3,4].\n\nThe Copenhagen Interpretation posits that quantum systems do not have definite properties in the absence of observation, which leads to the notion that the reality perceived is somewhat dependent on the observer. Niels Bohr famously stated that quantum entities cannot be described as fully real until they are measured [5]. \n\nWhile the philosophical implications of observer dependence in quantum mechanics have prompted debates about the nature of reality, it is important to delineate between observer consciousness and the process of measurement itself. Scientific perspectives emphasize that these effects stem from the interaction process and are not necessarily contingent upon a conscious observer [8,18]. \n\nIn conclusion, while the role of the observer in the quantum realm may challenge our perceptions of an objective reality, it primarily underscores the intricate interplay between measurement and state determination in quantum systems.","probability":0.0952525015}

In quantum theory, the act of observing can change the very thing you look at [6]. The act of observing particles not only brings them into existence but affects their behavior [6]. This is a very significant finding because it starts to expose some of the connections between mind and matter [6]. \nAccording to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, observing an object causes it to lose its quantum nature and collapse into the classical form people are used to [2,3]. However, the moment that a conscious observer observes the system it suddenly stops obeying the laws of QM and, rather than being in a superposition of states, snaps to one state [2,3,4]. And an observer does not merely observe reality but also creates it [2]. If left to themselves, things would remain as waves until somebody observe them [2]. Essentially, the act of observation creates a definite reality [3]. \nQuantum mechanics has proved a turning point to the world of physics [4].

The movement's roots in suprematism and the legacy of artists like Marcel Duchamp, who challenged artistic norms with \"ready-mades\", further highlight the creative lineage that informed minimalism [0, 16].\n\nMinimalism, then, can be seen as emerging from creativity in the sense of reimagining art's purpose and form, stripping away traditional layers to explore fundamental aesthetics [4, 13]. The creative act was in the reduction itself, aiming to present the bare essence of art without narrative or subjective interpretation [11, 13]. In conclusion, minimalism's connection to creativity is complex; it both epitomizes creativity through radical simplification and draws from existing innovative currents, making it a product of both revolutionary and evolutionary artistic thinking.","probability":0.092352097}

Unlike geometric abstraction, which solely bases on a two-dimensional approach, minimalist can also be three-dimensional [3]. Abstract has become so popular because it requires artists and viewers to use more of their imagination [3]. When looking at an abstract piece, for example, the human mind starts processing information in a different way than it is when dealing with figurative art [3]. Most abstract artworks leave many details unspecified, thus, prompting the human mind to come up with these details through imagination [3]. The process is very pleasurable and satisfying [3]. It develops human creativity and makes us think outside the box [3]. \nMinimalism, in stark contrast, takes form, color, and space and reduces them to such simplicity to attain their essential nature [4]. At this point, the philosophy goes, one can\u2019t remove anything else from the design to improve it further in any way, shape or form [4]. That\u2019s when you know that true minimalism has been reached [4]. The focus of minimalism was to break away from the excessive and overly decorative, and focus on raw materials and brutal simplicity [7].\nMinimal art emerged as a protest against abstract expressionism in the 1940s and 1950s [1,2]. Minimalists sought to convey the essence of the depicted objects, cutting off everything that, in their view, distracted attention from the main [0,1,2]. The author of the term \u201cminimalism\u201d was a British philosopher and art historian Richard Walheim [0,1]. He singled out this direction, analyzing the creativity of the artists who go in their works by the least interference with the world around them [0,1]. The origins of minimalism lie in such currents as pop art and suprematism [0,1].","probability":0.4475232067}

Emerging in the 1960s as a formal style, minimalism was a reaction against the elaborate subjectivity and emotional intensity of abstract expressionism that dominated earlier decades. Instead, it advocated for simplicity, focusing on reducing elements to their bare essentials to highlight their fundamental nature [1,4,6]. \n\nThe movement's roots can be identified in earlier artistic currents such as suprematism and constructivism, where pioneers like Kazimir Malevich experimented with geometric abstraction [1,16]. Minimalism as an art form took shape with artists in New York embracing geometric forms, monochromatic palettes, and industrial materials, thereby eliminating traditional storytelling or emotional expression from their work [3,18]. Renowned figures such as Donald Judd and Frank Stella exemplified this stripped-down aesthetic, underscoring the objective nature of art [18].\n\nWhile minimalism heavily draws upon creative decisions about form, color, and material usage, it simultaneously represents a profound departure from preceding elaborate styles, marking both continuity and protest in its evolution. This duality suggests that minimalism is as much a product of innovative thinking as it is a deconstruction of complex artistic traditions, thereby deeply rooting the movement in creative processes [5,7]. Thus, minimalist art indeed springs from creativity, as it seeks to reimagine and redefine artistic expression by eliminating everything but the essentials.","probability":0.0721635179}

The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the use of zoning laws to regulate such businesses under the \"secondary effects\" doctrine, which allows regulation based on the potential negative impacts, such as crime and decreased property values, rather than the expressive content itself [0, 1, 4]. \n\nThis approach is exemplified in cases like \"Young v. American Mini Theatres\" and \"City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.\", where zoning laws were upheld to keep adult businesses distanced from residential areas or from each other [2, 5]. Such zoning is considered a valid use of local governments' police powers, setting boundaries for expressions that are protected by the First Amendment yet are deemed to have less protection due to their potential secondary impacts [4, 6].\n\nZoning can restrict expressional culture indirectly by influencing which areas within a city become cultural or entertainment hubs, as seen with the establishment of \"red light\" districts for sexually oriented businesses [8, 17]. This not only confines adult expressive businesses to certain areas but potentially shapes the cultural landscape of communities by defining where cultural activities can thrive. Consequently, zoning laws reflect prevailing community values and can either facilitate or restrict certain types of expression and the development of cultural districts [10, 11].","probability":0.0029662732}

The state's political identity began to shift significantly in the mid-20th century, notably marked by the 1944 merger of the Minnesota Democratic Party with the Farmer-Labor Party to form the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). This fusion drew support from farmers and labor unions, bolstering progressive causes within the state [0, 5, 6]. The influence of notable liberal politicians such as Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale further solidified Minnesota's progressive credentials, as they championed civil rights and social reforms [4, 10].\n\nAdditionally, Minnesota's Scandinavian heritage contributed to a political culture skeptical of large corporations, fostering an environment conducive to policies that support social welfare and economic fairness [1].

As millions of Americans left urban centers for newly developed suburban neighborhoods, the role of the father was strongly characterized by the expectation to be the primary economic provider, or breadwinner. This ideal was deeply entrenched in the vision of the \"American Dream,\" where fathers were seen as financially supporting their wives and children, often through long and demanding commutes to earn a living [0,1,2].\n\nIn this suburban paradigm, the father assumed authority not only as the economic provider but also as the figure representative of traditional values; he led the family unit both practically and morally.

In a few cases dollarization has gone so far that the US dollar is accepted as a secondary or alternative currency to the local one [2]. Free trade blocks such as NAFTA and the creation of the Euro have taken the potential idea of single hemispheric currency and made it a potential reality. Those in developing countries such has Ecuador and Zimbabwe have pointed to dollarization as a means of saving their economy [2, 3]. Dollarization has also bolstered their economies in unintended ways such as promoting tourism to US citizens without the need of exchanging currency [7, 8]. Semi-dollarization is also a common practice for countries in the developing world. With semi-dollarization, alternative currencies are only used on private markets and amongst citizens and not formally recognized by the government [10].

Dollar pegging uses a fixed exchange rate for a given country's central bank to exchange to exchange local currency for the US dollar with business and citizens.

The concept of congruence, as introduced by Carl Rogers, emphasizes the importance of a child\u2019s perceptions of who they are versus the person they aspire to be aligning closely. When there is a significant discrepancy, known as incongruence, it can lead to maladjustment and psychological issues [0, 1, 2, 3].\n\nParents play a crucial role in fostering high congruence in their children through the provision of unconditional positive regard. This form of unconditional love allows a child to develop a caring attitude toward themselves, which is pivotal for accurate self-concept formation and self-actualization [0, 1, 5]. When love and acceptance are conditional, children must fulfill certain criteria to receive positive regard, potentially distorting their self-perceptions to meet these external conditions, which can increase incongruence [2, 6].\n\nTherefore, building an environment that encourages acceptance irrespective of achievements can serve as a foundational strategy for parents. This approach not only supports children in aligning their ideal and real selves but also offers them the freedom to explore their identities without fear of judgment. Subsequently, children raised in such nurturing environments are more likely to actualize their potential and exhibit traits of what Rogers described as the fully functioning person [10, 16].\n\nIn conclusion, unconditional positive regard is instrumental in helping children achieve high congruence, fostering both healthy psychological development and the continual pursuit of personal growth.","probability":0.1103406956}

According to the theories of humanistic psychologists Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow, parents can facilitate this process by offering unconditional positive regard. This concept involves providing love and acceptance without demanding the child meet certain conditions of worth, thereby nurturing an accurate self-concept and promoting congruence between a child's real and ideal selves [0,1,2,5,6].\n\nHigh congruence is essential for the optimal development of children's self-esteem and emotional stability. Rogers emphasized that when children feel accepted and prized, they develop a more caring attitude toward themselves, which is the foundation of a healthy self-concept [0,2,9]. On the contrary, conditional positive regard, where approval and love are contingent upon certain behaviors, can contribute to incongruence, leading to maladjustment and feelings of unworthiness [13,16].\n\nThe family environment is pivotal in shaping self-concept. An approach that respects the child's individuality and encourages growth through unconditional positive regard is instrumental. Parents who adapt to their child's needs and foster a \"goodness-of-fit\" between their parenting practices and the child's temperament can further enhance the development of a balanced and congruent self-image [18,19].

Such poems not only depict the struggles but also serve as calls to action for societal change.\n\nMoreover, poetry's ability to forge connections and evoke empathy is seen as pivotal in dismantling stereotypes and fostering a more just world. By presenting multiple perspectives, poetry encourages audiences to appreciate the complexities of racial issues beyond binary oppositions, promoting understanding and compassion [0,16]. \n\nIn this light, poetry not only serves as a medium of expression but as an influential force for social progression, equipping individuals with the empathy and insight necessary to address and heal the wounds inflicted by racism [0,11].","probability":0.0792099154}

By establishing Constantinople as the new capital, Constantine effectively reduced Rome's political and economic importance [0, 2, 6].\n\nThis move exacerbated the vulnerabilities of the Western Roman Empire. The economic neglect of the West further destabilized its already fragile condition. Constantine's fiscal policies included raising taxes in the Western regions to align them with those in the East, despite economic disparities. This decision strained the Western economy, contributing to its ongoing financial decline [1]. Additionally, military attention was diverted away from Rome to the Eastern frontiers, exposing the Western territories to increased invasions and attacks by tribes [14].\n\nThe division of the Empire following Constantine's reign made it easier for internal and external pressures to mount against the West. Without the leadership and resources once provided by a unified empire, Rome was left susceptible to attacks by various tribes, eventually being sacked in 410 AD by the Visigoths under King Alaric [4, 16].\n\nIn conclusion, Constantine's relocation of the capital, economic policies favoring the East, and diversion of military resources significantly contributed to the decline of Rome, setting the stage for the eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire.","probability":0.1112353143}

Constantine was Rome\u2019s first Christian emperor, and he is considered to have been a strong ruler.

The city of Rome, once the epicenter of one of the most powerful empires in history, began to deteriorate as infrastructure weakened, and territorial control in the West was lost due to increasing external pressures and diminishing resources [0, 3].\n\nConstantine's policies favored the Eastern Empire, leading to economic disparities between the two halves.

The West, lacking such support, faced increased invasions from Germanic tribes and a declining military presence [1, 6].\n\nThe relocation did not merely signify a geographic shift but also deepened the division within the empire, ultimately leading to the splintering into separate Eastern and Western empires.

The frequency of homicide of this startlingly high statistic warrant more concerted efforts to research the psychological underpinnings motivating homicide [3]. \nExplaining the motivations of a murderer historically has been a difficult task for psychologists because of the wide array of individual, situational, and cultural variables influencing the development of homicidal behavior [3]. Several theories have been developed over the brief history of psychology seeking explanations of the patterns of homicide [2,3].

In individualistic societies, individuals often prioritize personal goals and self-reliance, which can erode social cohesion and communal support systems that typically deter violent behavior. This phenomenon is exemplified by the United States, a highly individualistic society, which consistently reports higher homicide rates compared to more collectivist cultures like Japan, where societal norms emphasize group harmony and accountability. Such disparities highlight how cultural orientation towards individualism or collectivism can shape behavioral outcomes like crime rates [0, 1].\n\nMoreover, the theory of institutional anomie posits that cultural values such as pursuit of wealth and individual success, prevalent in individualistic societies, can foster conditions conducive to crime, including homicide. This is due to weak social institutions that inadequately regulate and integrate individual behaviors into collective norms, consequently leading to higher criminality [10, 13, 14]. Economic inequality, another characteristic sometimes associated with individualistic societies, further exacerbates this trend. A strong correlation exists between income inequality and homicide rates, as disparities in wealth often lead to social disenfranchisement and violence [16, 17, 19].\n\nIn conclusion, individualism can influence homicide rates by altering societal structures and norms that otherwise might inhibit violent behaviors. As seen in cross-cultural comparisons and theoretical perspectives on crime, individualistic values, when coupled with economic inequality, can create an environment where homicides are more prevalent. Addressing these factors through strengthening community ties and equitable social policies may help mitigate such outcomes.","probability":0.0936839753}

A notable cultural dichotomy exists when comparing individualistic societies like the U.S. and collectivist ones like Japan. The U.S., characterized by high levels of individualism, records elevated homicide rates, whereas Japan, a collectivist society, experiences higher suicide rates. This is partly attributed to cultural attitudes where, in individualistic societies, external blame is more commonly assigned, potentially leading to higher aggression and violence, exemplified by homicide. In contrast, in collectivist cultures, self-blame and internalization may lead to more suicides [0,1].\n\nFrom a sociological perspective, theories such as the institutional-anomie theory (IAT) highlight how economic frameworks focused on individual success and wealth attainment can exacerbate social inequality and lead to heightened violent crimes, including homicides. In the U.S., the drive for personal achievement often encounters systemic barriers, resulting in an environment where ethical boundaries blur, and crime rates, including homicide, may rise [10,12].\n\nMoreover, socioeconomic factors significantly influence homicide rates. Regions with pronounced income inequality, like various U.S. states, exhibit higher homicide rates. This correlation is strongly linked to the lack of social cohesion and trust in highly unequal societies [16,18]. The cultural emphasis on achieving the \"American Dream\" without equitable means to do so fuels anomic conditions conducive to crime [13,14].\n\nOverall, individualism's emphasis on personal success and economic disparities in individualistic societies contributes notably to higher homicide rates, while collectivism seems to mitigate such occurrences by emphasizing group conformity and responsibility.","probability":0.0753757206}

The theory says something in the vein of \"the body is or can be conditioned to automatically expect a reward and react to that expectation after experiencing a particular trigger.\" \n\nGrief is a triggered response [3]. It is activated by the loss of a loved one and is a normal psychobiological response to that loss [3]. It manifests in seven stages: \"shock or disbelief, denial, bargaining, guilt, anger, depression, and acceptance or hope [1,2,9,12,15].\n\nComplicated grief (chronic, intense, and possibly debilitating grief) is an unresolved kind of grief in which the symptoms of grief are very pronounced and long-lasting [0,1,4,5,10,12,13,16]. It has been shown to activate the parts of the brain associated with the trigger-and-reward response [0,10]. It causes an insatiable need to have the lost loved one back [0]. This persistent desire has been likened to an addiction [0].\n\nGrief may be aggravated or prolonged by other triggers - grief triggers [2]. Two examples of these triggers are memories of the loved one who has died and seeing images of them. Symptoms of this kind of grief include anxiety, depression, refusal to accept the loss, avoiding the normal stages of the grieving process, trouble recovering from the loss, inability to return to their own life, and [11,12,14,16] \n\nClassical conditioning may affect how someone copes with grief over the loss of a loved one.

Classical conditioning can significantly influence how individuals process such a loss, contributing to the development of various grief reactions.\n\nClassical conditioning, a learning process in which a response becomes associated with a previously neutral stimulus, can exacerbate grief through repeated associations with reminders of the deceased. For instance, encountering places or objects linked to the loved one can trigger intense emotional responses, reminiscent of the strong yearning and sadness often seen in complicated grief (CG) [0]. This process of conditioned responses can lead to prolonged or complicated grief by reinforcing the presence of the deceased in the daily life of the bereaved, thus hindering the acceptance of the loss and the ability to move forward.\n\nComplicated grief is characterized by a persistent yearning for the deceased, coupled with an inability to accept the reality of the loss, leading to maladaptive behaviors and thoughts [13]. This condition may be likened to an addiction, where the brain's reward pathways, such as the nucleus accumbens, are activated, perpetuating an unending cycle of yearning [0].\n\nAdditionally, classical conditioning can affect avoidance behaviors. The persistent avoidance of reminders of the loss due to conditioned fear or distress responses can prolong the grieving process by preventing the necessary confrontation and eventual acceptance of the loss [0, 12]. Managing these conditioned responses through therapeutic interventions, such as grief counseling, can aid in the resolution of grief and help individuals reorganize their lives without the deceased [0, 14].\n\nIn conclusion, classical conditioning can intensify and prolong the grieving process by reinforcing emotional responses and avoidance behaviors. Recognizing and addressing these conditioned responses is crucial for effective grief management and emotional healing.","probability":0.125631542}

This conditioning can intensify grief by creating persistent associations between reminders of the deceased and emotional reactions. For instance, stimuli or situations previously shared with the lost loved one may trigger distressing memories and emotions, reinforcing the grieving behavior and complicating the mourning process.\n\nComplicated grief, a condition characterized by prolonged and intense grief, can be partially explained through this lens. Studies have shown that complicated grief activates brain regions associated with reward and avoidance, such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala, resulting in an unfulfilled yearning for the deceased, akin to addiction[0]. This may lead the bereaved to continuously avoid reminders of their loss, further extending their grief[0].\n\nThe impact of this conditioning extends beyond the psychological realm, affecting physical health as well. Bereavement can lead to mental health issues like depression and anxiety, along with physical symptoms such as fatigue and nausea[3,6]. These responses are often exacerbated when the loss is sudden or traumatic[9,10].\n\nUnderstanding the role of classical conditioning in grief underscores the complexity of the mourning process and highlights the need for therapeutic interventions, such as cognitive behavioral strategies, that can help individuals break these conditioned associations and develop healthier coping mechanisms[14].

Hard skills have been in the market for centuries but now it is an era of soft skills. Critical thinking is one of the most important soft skills required in every walk of life [3]. Critical thinkers can evaluate the information available in media and can differentiate between fake and genuine facts. The information is everywhere. Without critical thinking, citizens cannot segregate the real facts from within the pool of facts [4]. Furthermore, social studies show that analysing multiple perspectives requires critical thinking and this leads to more informed decisions [5,6].

Crucially, this expansion allowed access to vital natural resources, such as minerals, timber, and fertile land, which were pivotal for agricultural and industrial growth [0, 1, 8].

The land gained through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 encompassed present-day California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, and parts of several other states, effectively stretching U.S. territory from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. This massive territorial expansion fueled the notion of Manifest Destiny, underpinning the United States' ambition to control the continent.\n\nEconomically, the newly acquired lands presented ample opportunities. The discovery of gold in California in 1849, known as the Gold Rush, was a major catalyst for economic growth, attracting large numbers of settlers and spurring infrastructure development[7,15]. The availability of other minerals such as silver, along with fertile agricultural land, transformed these regions into productive economic areas[0,1]. This expansion also facilitated the development of the railroad industry, consolidating a transportation network that linked the eastern and western United States, thus boosting commerce and communication[1].\n\nStrategically, gaining Pacific ports allowed the U.S. to engage in trade with Asia, significantly enhancing its international trading prospects[4,7]. This was particularly important for establishing diplomatic relations and expanding U.S. interests in the Pacific region.\n\nHowever, this growth did not come without consequences.

This practice was widespread throughout the United States in the 20th century, and Puget Sound wasn't left out. At its worst, redlining prevented marginalized groups of people from owning property or accessing bank loans. They were only forced to rent in the red neighborhoods [0,1]. The red areas in Seatle included Highland Park, Georgetown, Pioneer Square, Central District, and Downtown [0]. All these areas fall within the Puget Sound Lowlands, as the region is between the Cascade Mountains to the South and Canada to the North [4].\nThe construction of the US Interstate 5 (I-5) between 1956 and 1978 made redlining in the Puget Sound more pronounced. Taking Seattle as an example, I-5 divided the city into two. This resulted in white Seattlies and Black Seatlies. The northern part of the city is still dominated by the whites even today.\nRedlining was a discriminatory practice because it was used to determine where a particular ethnic group lived. Red zones were marked closer to industrial districts, ports, and rail lines. The commissioning of I-5 added to even more problems the impoverished people living close by faced, as it is a source of air pollution in Puget Sound. They lived in such environmentally hazard places because redlining made it impossible to acquire safe property elsewhere [0.1].","probability":0.0527383103}

Redlining was a discriminatory practice formalized in the early 20th century when financial institutions denied loans and insurance to residents in predominantly African-American neighborhoods, marking these areas in red on maps as hazardous for investment based on racial criteria [0,2]. This practice systematically restricted minority communities\u2019 access to homeownership and forced them into limited geographic areas, such as the Central District and other urban neighborhoods in Seattle [0,2].\n\nAs I-5 was constructed and developed over the decades, it often intersected and interacted with these historically marginalized neighborhoods, magnifying their isolation and disadvantage. The highway, following pre-existing urban divides, played a role in the physical separation of communities. For example, I-5 cuts through densely populated urban centers and has contributed to traffic congestion, further isolating neighborhoods and reinforcing economic and social divides [9,17].\n\nThe highway\u2019s route and construction were part of broader urban development efforts that often disregarded the needs of minority communities, prioritizing infrastructure over the socio-economic fabric of affected areas. This has resulted in continued challenges for residents in these neighborhoods, such as inadequate infrastructure and limited mobility options. Therefore, while I-5 serves as a major transportation artery essential for regional connectivity, it also reflects the lingering impacts of historical redlining practices that have shaped the socio-economic landscape of the Puget Sound region [9,15].","probability":0.092833507}

This practice enforced racial segregation, as white neighbourhoods such as Capitol Hill implemented restrictive covenants that prohibited selling or renting homes to Black individuals, with such covenants covering 183 blocks by 1947 [1, 2, 3]. A 1975 study revealed that major banks severely limited loans in areas like Central Seattle and Rainier Valley, prompting the Seattle City Council to create the Public Reinvestment Board in 1976 to counteract discriminatory lending practices [1, 2]. \nThe Puget Sound region, notably the i-5 corridor, serves as Washington's most densely populated area [4, 7, 8]. It encompasses major cities, industries and transport hubs [4]. i-5 connecting cities like Seattle, Tacoma, and Olympia, play a crucial role in this infrastructure, facilitating both land and maritime traffic through the region [5, 6, 7]. It also serves as a central artery for transportation that has significant implications for housing demand and job distribution in central Puget Sound [5, 6].\nHowever, the construction of i-5 disrupted Seattle's urban fabric, physically dividing neighbourhoods and contributing to increased sprawl and traffic congestion [9]. The highway's design has led to significant traffic issues, with Seattle-area drivers spending an average of 38 hours annually in traffic, particularly on the congested stretch from Northgate to Union Street [10, 11]. This is prone to slowdowns during peak commuting hours due to design issues and merging traffic [10, 11]. Expansion of military facilities, such as Joint Base Lewis-McChord, has further intensified congestion on i-5 [12, 13]. This highlights the need for effective transportation strategies to manage the growing demand on this critical corridor [12, 13].\ni-5, established in 1957 and completed by 1969, is Washington's only north-south interstate stretching 277 miles from the Oregon border to the Canadian border [2, 15]. It serves as a key transport route for approximately 70% of the state's population, with a daily vehicle average exceeding 274,000 in Downtown Seattle [16]. The highway not only connects major urban areas but also facilitates important international travel through key military and transportation hubs, emphasizing its integral role in Washington's economic and social landscape [18, 19].","probability":0.0706589218}

Constructed during a period of significant urban change, the highway's development reinforced existing racial and socio-economic divides shaped by decades of discriminatory practices. The practice of redlining, where financial institutions denied loans and insurance to areas predominantly inhabited by African Americans and other minority groups, directly influenced the urban layout and the location of communities within Seattle[0,1,2].\n\nThe I-5 corridor, serving as a major thoroughfare through Washington, sliced through many neighborhoods, including several historically marginalized communities disproportionately affected by redlining. Areas like Seattle's Central District and Rainier Valley, which were labeled as hazardous and redlined, became physically and economically isolated by the freeway's construction. This further entrenched the socio-economic divisions created by redlining, as these communities were often left with inadequate infrastructure and economic disinvestment[0,1,9].\n\nI-5 now stands as a crucial infrastructure component for regional connectivity in the Puget Sound. Despite its role in facilitating economic integration and transport, the freeway remains emblematic of the post-war urban planning approaches that often neglected the concerns of minority communities in favor of broader economic interests[15,17].

She believes these actions, while small, can collectively nudge businesses and policymakers toward adopting sustainable practices [1].

In response, American merchants called upon the U.S. military to aid in the overthrow of the Kingdom, a nation which had been allied by treaty to the United States for more than seventy years [0].\nHawaii previously benefited from low tariff rates, but the Tariff Act of 1890 raised the cost of Hawaiian sugar and the new law nearly destroyed Hawaii\u2019s industry [3]. Hawaii\u2019s sugar owners came up with a plan to save their industry; they would overthrow Queen Liliuokalani and push for the U.S. to annex Hawaii [3]. Once under U.S. rule, Hawaii\u2019s sugar producers would no longer pay tariffs [3]. Facing economic hardship and potential loss of power, American missionaries, business entrepreneurs, and European and American politicians began to seriously consider the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy and annexation of the islands by the U.S. [4].\nIn 1893, they formed a \u201cCommittee of Safety\u201d to accomplish their goals of overthrowing the Hawaiian Kingdom and deposing the Queen, and the annexation of Hawaii to the United States [1]. On January 16th in 1893, sailors and marines aboard the USS Boston in Honolulu Harbor came ashore under orders of neutrality [1,2]. The presence of these troops, ostensibly to enforce neutrality and prevent violence, were effectively a threat to Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani and made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself [1].

The islands' strategic location in the Pacific Ocean made them a desirable military base for the United States, particularly as the nation sought to project power across the globe. Additionally, Hawaii\u2019s burgeoning sugar industry was heavily dominated by American plantation owners and businessmen, who were keen to circumvent tariffs that adversely affected their profits. This economic impetus was further intensified by the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which significantly increased import rates on foreign sugar, triggering a recession in Hawaii and persuading many American business interests of the benefits of annexation to eliminate these trade barriers [0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 14].\n\nThe political climate in Hawaii added to the tensions; Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani's efforts to draft a new constitution to restore monarchical power and expand voting rights threatened the influence that foreign business elites had gained under previous rule [1, 13, 18]. In response, American and European businessmen formed the Committee of Safety to orchestrate the Queen's overthrow. With the support of U.S. military forces, particularly the USS Boston's Marines, they successfully carried out the coup, installing a provisional government led by Sanford Dole [1, 2, 10].\n\nDespite the coup, immediate annexation did not occur due to political opposition in the United States, including from President Grover Cleveland, who opposed imperialism. Nevertheless, Hawaii was eventually annexed in 1898 during the administration of President William McKinley against the backdrop of the Spanish-American War, underlining the strategic military value of Hawaii to the United States [6, 19].","probability":0.1189870708}

This was true of immigrants from all countries, including Irish immigrants who worked for less and got jobs instead of Americans [2].\n\nSecondly, the large numbers of immigrants flooded the job market, making jobs harder to come by [1,3,4,8,9,10,19]. Native-born Americans also felt the mass immigration of workers combined with the fact that immigrants were willing to work for less money would cause wages to fall [1,5,9,10,12,17].\n\nHistorically, immigrants were used to break strikes [1,9]. The immigrants' willingness to take the jobs of striking workers amplified the feeling among Americans that the immigrants wanted to take their jobs.\n\nAdditionally, Immigrants were willing to work in poor working conditions [1,3,5,7,11,17]. Immigrants were also willing to take on very physically demanding jobs which often required unskilled labour, such as in mines, mills, factories, sweatshops, and shipping docks. [3,5,7,11,18]. These were often jobs that native-born Americans were unwilling to take on but they still felt resentment toward immigrants for taking these jobs [3,5,7,11].\n\nLastly, the feeling that immigrants wanted to take their jobs may have also come from a lack of meaningful interactions between Americans and immigrants [3]. There was the (real and perceived) issue of the lack of assimilation of the immigrants into the way of life of Americans [3,7,11].

Historically, many Americans, particularly during times of economic distress, have perceived immigrants as a threat to job security and wages. This sentiment was especially pronounced following World War I, when high unemployment rates and deteriorating economic conditions made job scarcity a pressing concern. Immigrants were frequently depicted as willing to work for lower wages, thus undercutting American workers and sparking fears of job displacement [0, 1, 4].\n\nMoreover, nativist attitudes were fueled by cultural and religious differences. Many immigrants hailed from countries with different cultural traditions or religious backgrounds, such as Catholics from Ireland and Italy or Jewish communities, which led to cultural tensions. Nativists believed that such differences could undermine the cultural homogeny of American society [0, 11, 16]. Additionally, immigrants were accused of reluctance to assimilate, opting instead to maintain distinct communities, which heightened suspicion and fostered resentment among native-born Americans [3, 11].\n\nThese factors culminated in legislative actions to curb immigration, as exemplified by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and other immigration restrictions that followed. Such policies were indicative of the broader socio-economic and cultural dynamics that influenced American perceptions of immigrants as a threat to their livelihood [1, 4, 16].\n\nIn conclusion, the belief that immigrants were poised to usurp jobs from Americans was fueled by economic anxieties and cultural biases, and it played a significant role in shaping the U.S. immigration policy landscape.

As the United States experienced waves of immigration, particularly from Southern and Eastern Europe, native-born workers feared that newcomers would accept lower wages and thereby threaten existing jobs and living standards. This fear was magnified during periods of economic distress, such as the post-World War I economic downturn, when high unemployment intensified competition for jobs and housing [0,1,2].\n\nAdditionally, many immigrants were accused of being strikebreakers, a role that further entrenched the perception that they were undermining local labor markets [3,9]. Cultural and religious differences also fueled nativist sentiments; many Americans were wary of immigrants who resisted rapid assimilation and held religious beliefs different from the predominantly Protestant population. Irish and Italian immigrants, who were mainly Catholic, often encountered prejudice tied to these aspects [0,1,7].\n\nIn response, restrictive immigration laws were enacted, starting with regulatory measures in the late 19th century aimed at limiting new arrivals, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and literacy tests established in the following decades [1,4,16].

The physical demands of the season, including disrupted routines and excess consumption of food and alcohol, can amplify these stressors [5,8].\n\nUltimately, the combination of unrealistic expectations, financial burdens, social isolation, and physical strains creates a challenging environment in which the holiday spirit can feel diminished for many [7,9,19]. Recognizing these stressors and managing expectations might provide some relief, allowing individuals to find joy in genuine, personal moments rather than idealized versions portrayed commercially or in media [12].","probability":0.0769157809}

To begin with, the military pay structure is set, and people are paid according to rank as well as type of assignment [2, 6]. New recruits in the US Marines will net only $19,224 a year [3].

Within the organization, there is a culture of pride and privilege to serve that goes beyond financial renumeration, and that risk, honor and bravery are often regarded as more central to the decision to sign up than a large pay check [5, 6]. Therefore, there may be a lack of desire from within the organization to enact change that may increase take-home pay for Marines.\n\nTo conclude, the salary for serving in the Marines may appear surprisingly low for such a risky occupation, but when the additional benefits are taken into account, the value provided the job increases to be more in line with civilian employment. In addition, part of the reason that the take-home figure of pay stays low may be due to a culture within the organization that values endurance and bravery above financial reward. \n","probability":0.0572272688}

This issue arises from several structural and philosophical aspects inherent to military compensation. The pay for military personnel, including Marines, is determined by rank and years of service rather than by the complexity or risks associated with their specific duties [18,0]. This structure can lead to situations where Marines, who might be required to perform exceptionally hazardous tasks, receive relatively modest financial compensation [0,1].\n\nMoreover, the military traditionally emphasizes benefits such as housing allowances and free healthcare as significant components of their overall compensation package. These benefits can add substantial value but might not equate to higher salaries found in equivalent civilian jobs [2,3]. The philosophy within the Marine Corps also plays a role; there is a strong emphasis on service and sacrifice over monetary gain, a cultural value that aligns with the Marines' austere and disciplined ethos [5,11].\n\nWhile the base salary for junior enlisted Marines, like an E-1 private, starts modestly at approximately $1,785 per month, these amounts gradually increase with rank and duration of service [19]. Additionally, during discussions about their compensation, military leadership has at times highlighted the potential negative effects of higher pay on discipline and the Corps' war-fighting focus [7].\n\nIn conclusion, the relatively low compensation for Marines is a reflection of systemic pay structures based on rank and tenure, the significant non-monetary benefits offered, and the cultural ethos of the Corps that values service over financial reward.","probability":0.0668449509}

Boeing 737 MAX planes were grounded worldwide in March 2019 after 346 people were killed in crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia [7].

An investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice revealed that Boeing had concealed critical information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regarding the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which played a crucial role in two fatal crashes involving the aircraft model. These actions were part of a broader strategy to prioritize economic gains over safety, resulting in the underestimation of pilot training needs, thereby jeopardizing aviation safety standards [0,1,2].\n\nThe concealment of critical safety information constituted a conspiracy to defraud the government. This is because Boeing's employees deliberately misled the FAA by providing false statements regarding MCAS operations, effectively inhibiting the agency's regulatory functions [6]. These actions were deemed severe enough to incur significant financial penalties. In 2021, Boeing agreed to a settlement involving a $2.5 billion payment, including a monetary penalty, compensations to affected airlines, and funds allocated to victims' families [1,7,8].\n\nSuch misconduct highlights the broader challenges of regulatory oversight, particularly when authorities predominantly rely on manufacturers for compliance assurance [4,5].

Both the Federalists, led initially by Alexander Hamilton, and the later Democratic Party, have historically championed the authority and intervention of a strong national government over states' rights. This is evident in the Federalists' advocacy for a loose interpretation of the Constitution that permitted expansive federal powers, which aligns with the modern Democratic inclination towards federal-centric governance solutions for national issues, such as economic regulations and social programs [5,6,14,16].\n\nAnother similarity lies in the organizational structure of both parties. Like the Federalists, the Democratic Party has been structured at both federal and state levels, facilitating organized political strategies across multiple government tiers [0,3]. Both parties also emerged from significant political disputes; the Federalists arose in response to perceived inadequacies in the Articles of Confederation, while the Democratic Party formed partly due to fractures within earlier American political landscapes [1,4].\n\nDespite these similarities, it is paramount to acknowledge that each party originated under different historical contexts and catered to their contemporary constituencies\u2019 needs and priorities. While the Federalists were more aligned with business interests and elitism, the Democrats transitioned to champion broader populist and socially liberal agendas [9,13]. Thus, while parallels exist, they must be interpreted within the nuances of their historical and temporal contexts.","probability":0.0685240749}

However, this perception is often more symbolic than factual, lacking a legal definition or specific conditions under which it can be unquestionably applied [5, 8, 13].\n- Historically, presidents have claimed mandates to justify their policy agendas, leveraging electoral success as proof of public support. However, the claim of a mandate often falls prey to political interpretation and does not automatically garner Congressional compliance [0, 8, 11].\n- Critics argue that the notion of a presidential mandate is misleading because it presumes that a single election can deeply validate a comprehensive slate of policies. This ignores the complex reality that voters' preferences are nuanced and may not align uniformly with the president's agenda [1, 2].\n- \"Executive mandate\" and \"legislative mandate\" are distinct concepts involving different scopes of authority. Presidents might leverage perceived mandates to push policies, but this does not easily translate into legislative successes unless there is significant bipartisan support [10, 11].\n- The framers of the U.S. Constitution intended for Congress, not the president, to be the legitimate representative of the people's will, further complicating the idea of a presidential mandate [3].\n- Therefore, while presidents and political commentators may invoke the idea of a mandate for rhetorical or strategic purposes, its grounding in practical governance is dubious and often contested [0, 3].","probability":0.0912620585}

A free mandate suggests the electorate accepts the president's general agenda while an imperative mandate suggests the electorate expects the president to fulfill pre-election promises [5,6,8,18]. \n\nNeedless to say, it is difficult (and possibly erroneous) to claim a president has either of these kinds of mandates since it is impossible to ascertain how much of the electorate actually approved of the president's agenda or expects the president to do a specific thing [2,13,18,19]. They may have cast their vote for that candidate because they simply did not want to cast it for the other one [13,18,19].\n\nTwo types of presidential mandate that one could more strongly argue do exist are the executive mandate and legislative mandate [10,11,17]. An executive mandate is said to be achieved simply by being the legitimately elected president - according to the laws of the United States [10]. A legislative mandate is one earned by having received the popular vote [11,17]. It is supported by the idea that the things the president wants to do are the things most of the electorate would approve of [7,11,17].

Rarely does a majority align entirely with a candidate's comprehensive agenda; thus, claiming a blanket mandate is misleading [0,1,3].\n\nPresidential mandates are more about perceived authority and political leverage rather than constitutional or electoral certainties. This perception can influence legislative dynamics as Congress may yield to a popular president's agenda, fearing electoral repercussions if they do not align with the constituents\u2019 perceived desires. Yet, such influence is not guaranteed and often circumstantial, relying on the president's ability to mobilize support within and across party lines [7,11].\n\nHistorically, the idea has served more as a political tool than a formal power, used rhetorically by presidents to assert authority and sway legislative processes. Presidents have invoked mandates to assert that their victories confer implicit approval of their policies, pressing Congress to enact their legislative agendas.

At its core, rent-seeking involves entities expending resources to gain economic benefits through the manipulation of public policy rather than through productive activities. This behavior can lead to forced exchanges, as consumers are compelled to accept higher prices or restricted services resulting from the artificial constraints created by rent-seeking activities. For instance, in the U.S. taxi industry, the issuance of limited licenses constrains supply and forces consumers to pay higher prices, essentially transferring wealth to taxi business proprietors without added value [2,3,8].\n\nAdditionally, rent-seeking can lead to blocked exchanges, particularly through lobbying efforts aimed at establishing monopolistic protections or regulatory barriers. The case of Tesla facing opposition from car dealerships exemplifies how lobbying can block market entry and innovation by enacting laws that mandate cars be sold through dealerships, hindering direct sales models [0]. Similarly, in the telecommunications sector, AT&T has actively engaged in rent-seeking to maintain monopolistic control over cable services by opposing policies that would increase competition [1,6].\n\nSuch practices not only result in inefficient allocation of resources but can also stifle competition, raise entry barriers, and impose a societal cost by redirecting resources from productive endeavors to policy manipulation [3,5,16].

It must be pointed out that these monopolies are not always held by single corporations but sometime take the form of groups of companies or individuals within a sector or industry \n\nExamples of exchanges being forced or blocked can be found in almost all sectors of the economy.

Consequently, markets face limited competition, elevated prices, and high entry barriers, restricting fair exchange opportunities.\n\nAn illustrative case is Tesla's struggle with car dealers lobbying for laws mandating cars be sold through dealerships. This effectively blocks Tesla's direct-sales model, demonstrating how rent-seeking can obstruct free market exchanges [0]. Similarly, AT&T\u2019s efforts to maintain monopoly profits highlight how rent-seeking can lead to forced transactions.

The shortage of steel, primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, arose from several factors including the temporary closure of steel production facilities leading to reduced output by about 19 million tons in the U.S. in the second and third quarters of 2020 [0,1]. Although production facilities are gradually reopening, they are struggling to catch up with the surging demand. This situation has been further aggravated by decreased steel imports, plummeting inventories, and extended lead-times for replenishing stock [0,2].\n\nThe microchip shortage, though largely a result of increased demand for consumer electronics during the pandemic, is also indirectly impacted by steel shortages. Steel is an essential material in the construction of manufacturing equipment and facilities, including those used for semiconductor production. The delay in the supply of these materials affects the capacity to produce semiconductors efficiently, thereby extending lead times and contributing to the ongoing chip shortages [11,13]. \n\nIn conclusion, while the direct reasons for the microchip shortage include heightened demand and geopolitical tensions, the shortage in steel supply further strains the infrastructure needed for semiconductor manufacturing.

This can affect how much businesses choose to trust market research [1,10]. Businesses may want to estimate how many products they sell in a financial period, but that number is not certain until the end of that period. By collecting data from previous sales, a business can estimate the value of future sales. The confidence interval then helps the business determine the range the sales will fall into. This would be a form of risk management, as companies can plan ahead if estimates are incorrect [1,2,3,4,10,12,13]. Even though many parts of statistical analysis is important for businesses, the confidence interval is an essential part of risk management, as estimates without it can play a significantly detrimental role to the outcomes and decisions made based on those values [4,5,12,13]. Statistical accuracy for these estimates and the confidence interval are dependent on the amount of data, as the results of the analysis with more data ranges closer to an accurate result [15,16,17,18].

They provide a range within which one can expect the true value of an estimated parameter to lie, with a specified level of confidence, usually 95% or 99% [0]. In the context of business, confidence intervals offer insights into the reliability of various estimates, such as sales forecasts or market research findings.\n\nIn market research, confidence intervals help businesses determine the reliability of sales forecasts by providing a range within which they expect their sales to fall. This understanding allows firms to make informed decisions about inventory and staffing without overcommitting resources [1,10]. Additionally, confidence intervals play a critical role in risk management. They provide an estimate of how likely certain events are, which allows businesses to prepare for possible best and worst-case scenarios and manage financial risks more effectively [2].\n\nMoreover, confidence intervals are used in budget forecasting to ascertain potential ranges for both revenues and costs. By doing so, companies can make more accurate financial plans and prepare adequately for unexpected outcomes [3,4]. Similarly, in regression analysis and decision analysis, confidence intervals guide businesses in evaluating the precision of their predictive models and the underlying assumptions, thus informing better strategic decisions [4,12].\n\nOverall, confidence intervals aid businesses in quantifying uncertainty and risk, therefore improving the quality of strategic planning and decision-making processes.

A company will want to have an idea of how many products it will sell in a given financial period, but cannot know the true number with certainty until after the end of the period [1]. By collecting data from customers, past sales numbers and other sources, a company can statistically estimate the value of future sales [1,10].

Since no estimate can be 100 percent reliable, businesses must be able to know how confident they should be in their estimates and whether or not to act on them [0]. For example, a business might estimate that a machine uses 10 lbs. of plastic for each unit of a product created [0]. Because the machine cannot be expected to use precisely 10 lbs. per unit, a confidence interval can be created to give a range of possibilities [0]. The company might predict that there is a 95 percent chance that the machine uses on average between 9.85 and 10.5 lbs. of plastic per unit [0,10]. The confidence interval in this example is 95 percent, and the likelihood that the actual amount of plastic used is outside the estimated range is 5 percent [1,10]. ","probability":0.263524492}

Should estimates significantly deviate without accounting for uncertainty, businesses could face financial difficulties[2,3].\n\nConfidence intervals also underline the importance of sample size in statistical analysis. Smaller samples generally yield wider intervals, indicating greater uncertainty and caution in interpreting results, which impacts decision-making accuracy[5,12].

Maps provide students with the critical ability to visualize and contextualize geographic, economic, and social phenomena, thus expanding their understanding of the world beyond mere locations [0,2]. They offer a unique opportunity for students to explore historical transformations and current global dynamics through visual means. By evaluating map patterns, students enhance their spatial thinking abilities, which are crucial in subjects such as geography and earth sciences [1,18].\n\nMoreover, maps can serve as an effective cross-curricular educational tool. For instance, they can be used not only in geography classes but also in history to understand historical contexts and in mathematics to analyze statistical information such as distance calculations and graphing [5]. Utilizing maps allows students to develop problem-solving skills as they engage with real-world scenarios, such as determining the fastest route to a destination or interpreting demographic data [0,1,6].\n\nFurthermore, teaching with maps encourages students to critically engage with the material, as maps are social constructs subject to analysis rather than direct representations of reality [1]. The use of maps in teaching also supports varied learning styles, thereby promoting inclusivity and engagement within the classroom [9].\n\nThus, by integrating maps into educational practices, educators not only enhance geographical literacy but also promote comprehensive analytical skills that students can apply across disciplines and in real-life contexts.

This shift reduced Moscow's engagement in non-aligned countries, especially as Yeltsin pursued closer ties with Western nations and adopted economic reforms aimed at integrating with the global market [1,4,9]. The withdrawal of Soviet support for various non-aligned countries meant these states had to seek alternative political and economic partnerships, which could lead to regional instability or realignment of international allegiances.\n\nFor example, India, a key non-aligned member, saw its longstanding bilateral relationship transition into a new post-Cold War dynamic through a treaty of friendship and cooperation during Yeltsin's tenure [2]. This partnership underscored a pragmatic shift in relations as both countries adapted to changed geopolitical realities, emphasizing economic collaboration over ideological alignment.\n\nIn conclusion, while Yeltsin's era brought about democratic reforms and market liberalization within Russia, it presented both challenges and opportunities for non-aligned nations as they redefined their foreign relations in a post-Soviet world.

It sends the message that the reason to work hard and stay in school is to make our bank account fatter instead of growing the knowledge we keep in our minds [1].\n\n- It might be argued that the use of reward and punishment is a manipulative form of behavior management, where punishment introduces an element of threat and the reward becomes a kind of bribe. This view would suggest that children are learning to change their behavior patterns for the wrong reasons, i.e. because there is something in it for them. In fact, the offering of rewards gives the child a reason to withdraw his cooperation once a reward is no longer on offer [2].\n\n- In many districts, standardized exam results have become the single most important indicator of school performance. As a result, teachers and administrators feel enormous pressure to ensure that test scores consistently rise. Schools narrow and manipulate the curriculum to match the test, while teachers tend to cover only what is likely to be on the next exam [3].\n\n- Another way children are manipulated is: Children in remedial tracks, especially, are labeled negatively by their school administrators, teachers, peers, and, most significantly, themselves.

However, that has not been the case where incentives are involved. Rewarding a hardworking student is not entirely negative, but over-relying on it to influence grades is not the right approach. Learners in elementary schools are given rewards, which include video game consoles. These habits make the learners entitled to their payouts [0,1,2]. \nGiving learners incentives for good grades is a form of behavioral manipulation. It creates an attitude in the learners who always look forward to what they get in return after taking any test. These tactics blind them from the value of education. It also shifts their sense of responsibility from themselves to others [0]. In other words, Incentives rob children of intrinsic rewards of learning [0]. \nInstead of paying or rewarding learners for attaining specific grades, which might mean nothing, educators and parents should help the students master skills needed to grow in the area of their lives [0]. Educational administrators should stop using manipulation tactics. Also, punishment should not be used to motivate learners to get good grades [2].

One common tactic is the reliance on extrinsic rewards to influence student behavior and performance. This approach shifts the focus from the intrinsic value of learning to the benefits of material rewards, thereby creating an attitude of entitlement and dependence on external validation rather than fostering a natural curiosity and motivation to learn. As a result, students may prioritize receiving rewards over comprehensive understanding, eventually undermining their intrinsic love for learning [0,1,2].\n\nThe pressure to meet standardized testing benchmarks can further contribute to manipulation. In many educational systems, these tests dictate curriculums, forcing teachers and administrators to focus narrowly on subjects and question types that will appear on exams. This narrow approach can stifle critical thinking and limit comprehensive educational experiences, effectively turning schools into test-preparation centers [3,4].\n\nMoreover, educational administrators might manipulate socio-economic and racial dynamics within schools by directing students to certain educational tracks based on test scores, often correlating with available resources and perceived potential. This process can disparately affect students from disadvantaged backgrounds who are more likely to be placed in lower-tier tracks, thereby perpetuating systemic inequality [5,6].\n\nIn conclusion, while some of these manipulative practices by educational administrators arise from systemic pressures, they can detrimentally affect students' development by emphasizing rewards and test preparation over genuine learning and equitable opportunities.

Another area of contention concerns Indians' business savvy.

In Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, the Supreme Court ruled that tribal courts lack jurisdiction to prosecute non-Indians, which many scholars criticized as a division reinforcing colonialist tendencies by crafting jurisdictional limitations not clearly based on historical legal precedents but rather on assumptions about tribal incompetence to adjudicate such cases [0, 2]. Professors like Bethany Berger argue that such jurisprudence used selective historical interpretation to deny tribes their inherent sovereignty [0, 1].\n\nMoreover, critics argue that such court decisions ignore or undermine Congressional efforts to affirm tribal jurisdiction. For example, shortly after the Supreme Court limited tribes' authority in Duro v. Reina, Congress amended the Indian Civil Rights Act to reaffirm tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-member Indians, a decision later upheld by the Supreme Court in United States v. Lara [0, 1]. This illustrates a legal and legislative landscape in which tribal sovereign powers are often contested and negotiated.\n\nIn conclusion, while critics argue that courts have overstepped in limiting tribal rights, these decisions must be weighed against Congressional efforts to restore or affirm tribal sovereignty. The complex dynamic between legislative and judicial actions reflects the ongoing struggle to balance respect for tribal governance with the broader frameworks of United States sovereignty [0, 6].

One of the most contentious cases is Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that tribal courts lack criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians on their lands. This decision, which many argue was rooted in outdated assumptions and colonial impulses, has been vigorously criticized for perpetuating a legacy of imperialism and undermining tribal sovereignty [0, 1, 2].\n\nThe critiques highlight that instead of relying on solid legal precedents, the Court\u2019s reasoning appeared to be largely based on assumptions about the capabilities of tribal courts.

Additionally, Professor Philip Frickey and Professor Robert Williams have condemned the decision as largely detrimental to the rights and autonomy of tribal entities [0].\n\nCongress did act to address some of the ramifications by passing amendments that upheld tribal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians, but the original ruling's effects remain pivotal in discussions about tribal sovereignty.

It is through facing challenges and overcoming obstacles that individuals develop the tenacity and strength to confront future difficulties. Adversity essentially serves as a catalyst for growth, encouraging individuals to respond constructively to setbacks and hardships. This response is instrumental in developing critical qualities such as confidence, courage, and perseverance [0, 1]. \n\nWhen individuals confront adversity, they learn to adapt and manage their emotions, leading to improved problem-solving abilities and enhanced self-esteem [2, 4]. As individuals navigate through hardships, they build resilience much like exercising a muscle, strengthening their capacity to handle future adversities [3]. The process of overcoming difficulties not only shapes one's character but also bolsters their ability to thrive despite unfavorable conditions [5]. \n\nFurthermore, adversity often facilitates personal growth, sometimes referred to as post-traumatic growth, wherein individuals derive new strengths and wisdom from their challenging experiences [6, 13]. This capability to grow from adversity relies heavily on one's mindset and the ability to perceive setbacks as opportunities for improvement and learning [7]. \n\nIn conclusion, experiencing adversity is indispensable in building resilience. Each hardship faced equips individuals with the necessary skills and confidence to surmount future challenges, ultimately transforming adversity into a stepping stone towards greater inner strength and personal development [0, 1, 12].","probability":0.1153582748}

Unlike text-heavy documents, an interactive syllabus integrates multimedia elements such as audio, video, images, and animations, which present information dynamically and engagingly [0, 1]. This approach not only makes the material more accessible and easier to navigate but also strengthens the connection between students and instructors by reflecting the instructor\u2019s presence and personality in the syllabus design [0].\n\nInteractive syllabi often employ various educational technology tools such as Thinglink, Piktochart, or Glogster to create engaging platforms [1]. Students can click on assignment titles to access detailed information or visit specific sections of the course, improving their ability to track and manage coursework. Such platforms can sync with calendars to offer real-time updates on due dates and course events, thus providing a seamless experience that aligns academic responsibilities with personal schedules [4].\n\nFurthermore, by incorporating interactive elements, the syllabus environment shifts from passive reception to active participation, promoting a more student-centered learning model [3, 18]. This technique is shown to increase student attendance and involvement as the enriched format stimulates a deeper cognitive engagement with course materials [3, 16].

In recent years, significant investments have been made, particularly in Oman and Saudi Arabia, aiming to exploit vast mineral reserves. Oman has taken notable steps, with Gulf Mining setting up the country's first chromite ore concentration plant and Mawarid producing copper in the Al Batinah region. The country is also engaging global investors to maximize its mineral wealth, driven by favorable government royalties and the potential of newly discovered non-metallic mineral reserves [0,1,14].\n\nSaudi Arabia, a major player in the region's mineral industry, has embraced large-scale mining projects. The Saudi Arabian Mining Company, or Ma'aden, has geared up to harness the country's extensive phosphate reserves, establishing itself as a leading phosphate producer with projects like the Wa'ad Al Shamal Minerals Industrial City [4]. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is also enhancing its gold production capabilities, with major expansions underway [3,7].\n\nThese initiatives in both countries are not only motivated by an abundance of untapped natural resources but also by strategic objectives to reduce economic dependency on oil revenues. The diversification into mining is expected to spur private investment, create employment opportunities, and foster sustainable economic development in the Gulf region [5,14]. The shift towards mining reflects a broader trend among Gulf states to prepare economic frameworks that ensure resilience against fluctuating oil markets and integrate into global supply chains beyond energy resources.","probability":0.0832239658}

However, as societal attitudes began to shift in the 1970s, discussions around marriage expanded to include same-sex unions, eventually leading to widespread legal recognition between 2003 and 2015. This shift is interpreted as a reflection of process philosophy's acknowledgment of change and flux in social structures [0, 2].\n\nSimultaneously, changes in the conceptual focus of marriage have been influenced by the rise of individualism. Marriages have increasingly been defined by personal fulfillment rather than by adherence to traditional duties, a shift that mirrors the philosophical transition from communal to individual values predominant since the 1960s and 1970s [7, 13, 16]. These philosophical shifts have resulted in more flexible views on marriage, encompassing a broader definition that prioritizes personal happiness and individual rights over conventional social norms.\n\nOverall, process philosophy\u2019s conception of reality as inherently dynamic and evolving has led to a more inclusive understanding of marriage and sparked significant legal and social reforms reflecting this philosophy\u2019s principles [0].","probability":0.0707003308}

Consequently, many resorts are moving higher into the mountains to ensure snow, though this also increases environmental risks such as avalanches [2,12,14].\n\nDespite these challenges, the Alps remain a vital economic player, generating close to EUR 50 billion in annual turnover while accounting for a significant portion of employment in the region [0,1]. Yet, since the 1980s, the number of tourists has been stable or declining in various areas, exacerbating economic difficulties and prompting depopulation in some regions of southern France, Italy, and Slovenia [0,10].\n\nEfforts continue to extend the tourist season beyond peak winter and summer months to mitigate congestion and diversify economic reliance [4]. The tourist industry employs more individuals than farming, and its scope includes a burgeoning service sector responding to outsourcing trends [4]. However, with ongoing climate challenges, the adaptability and resilience of Alpine tourism will be crucial for its sustained contribution to the local economy [15,16].","probability":0.0811357103}

Real estate, also known as real property, refers to immovable assets like land and structures that are affixed to it. This category of property includes not just the physical land, but also any buildings, minerals, and natural resources attached or beneath it[0,4]. In contrast, personal property is movable and consists of items such as vehicles, furniture, and clothing that are not permanently affixed to one location[5,19].\n\nThis differentiation originates from English common law and continues to play a significant role in modern legal systems[1]. Real property is subject to different laws than personal property, affecting areas such as taxation, transfer, inheritance, and ownership rights[2,16]. For instance, transactions involving real property often require formal documentation, like deeds, and convey different rights and responsibilities to ownership, typically referred to as a \"bundle of rights\"[13,18].\n\nLegal applications emphasizing this dichotomy include contract law, where sales of real property must be executed in writing, unlike many transactions involving personal property[17]. Moreover, in estate planning, real estate typically descends to heirs, whereas personal property might be distributed through an executor or administrator[9].\n\nIn conclusion, the distinction between real estate and personal property is profound and has numerous legal implications. Understanding these differences is crucial for navigating legal processes involving property ownership, transfer, and rights[3,6].","probability":0.1235324083}

Personal property is anything that can be moved. It\u2019s anything that can be subject to ownership, except land [0,1,3]. On the other hand, real property is property that cannot be moved.

Real property, often synonymous with real estate, encompasses land and anything permanently affixed to it, such as buildings and trees, and is inherently immovable. In contrast, personal property refers to movable items that can be owned, such as cars, furniture, and clothes, excluding land and anything attached to it [0, 1, 3, 6].\n\nThis differentiation stems from English common law and persists in modern legal systems, where distinct laws apply to each category. Real property involves legal rights associated with the land, including possession, sale, lease, and enjoyment, forming a \"bundle of rights\" that significantly influences ownership [4, 11, 14]. Personal property laws, conversely, deal with the ownership and transfer of movable assets [11].\n\nVarious legal areas are influenced by these distinctions. For instance, real property transactions must typically be documented in writing, whereas personal property transactions may not require such formalities [16, 17]. Additionally, estate law considers real property as inheritable and typically requires it to pass from an ancestor to a heir, unlike personal property which can be distributed by an executor upon death [8, 10].\n\nUnderstanding these classifications is crucial for navigating legal rights and responsibilities regarding property ownership and transfer.

Overall, in the USA, approximately 1000 civilians are killed by police officers each year[0,1,2,4,12,13,18,19]. If one defines \"innocent victim\" as \"unarmed civilians\", then the number is 51 in 2016 and 68 in 2017[1]. Compared the number to fatal shootings of armed civilians, which are 912 in 2016 and 919 in 2017, the prevalance of \"innocent victims\" being killed by police officers would appear to be low[1]. However, there are complicating factors that should be considered when evaluating exactly how often police officers cause \"innocent\" civilian deaths.\n\nOne such factor is the complex nature of \"innocence\" when dealing with potentially life-or-death situations, as officers frequently are. Shooting an unarmed suspect can be considered to be justified if a suspect makes a furtive movement, attacks an officer, or tries to take the officer's firearm[6]. Each case of officer-related death is evaluated on its own merit regarding whether the use of deadly force was justified[1,6]. It should be noted that in the USA, there is no comprehensive, mandatory record of people killed by police; the FBI runs a voluntary program for the submission of \"justified homicides\". In 2013, this program recorded 461 \"justifiable homicides\"[2,12]. In addition, in 98% of officer-related shootings, the officers are not charged[3]. It is also notable that Black people and mentally ill people are disproportionately represented amongst those killed, but due to a lack of data scientists have had difficulty studying the impact of biases on the use of deadly force[11,14,16,17,18].\n\nUltimately, the difference between \"justifiable\" and \"non-justifiable\" comes down to the individual situation and the people who evaluate it, who are typically law enforcement officials themselves[1]. There is also a lack of data from police departments that obscures the issue further[2,12].

People often claim it is cheaper to eat at a restaurant than to prepare a meal at home. Most Americans are overscheduled and overcommitted.

This perspective is prevalent among people experiencing hectic lifestyles, where the demands of work, school, and various activities leave little room for meal planning and preparation. The convenience and widespread availability of fast food make it a popular option despite its known health risks[1,4,7]. Time constraints, notably in households where both parents are employed, exacerbate this reliance on convenient, albeit unhealthy, food options[5,6].\n\nThe pervasive belief that preparing healthy meals is time-consuming has led many to substitute nutritious food with calorically dense, nutrient-poor alternatives. Fast food, known for its high fat and sugar content, has become a staple for those juggling multiple responsibilities each day[2,7]. Consequently, fast food satisfies immediate hunger and fits seamlessly into a time-crunched schedule, at the expense of long-term health outcomes such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases[2,9,16].\n\nMoreover, socio-economic factors interplay with time scarcity, influencing dietary habits. Individuals with lower incomes, who often work extended hours, may find it more economical and practical to consume fast food, a decision compounded by limited access to healthier options[7,12,15]. This intersection of time and financial constraints severely impacts food choices.\n\nIn summary, the lack of time is frequently blamed for poor diet choices, a claim supported by the intertwinement of modern lifestyle demands with the convenience and accessibility of fast food[0,1,4].

This often involves influencing policy to secure favorable conditions, such as monopolies or subsidies, which redistribute wealth rather than create it [1,5,16].\n- One outcome of rent-seeking is the creation of forced exchanges, where transactions are pushed onto consumers or competitors through regulatory means. An example includes car dealers lobbying to enforce dealership-based sales, restricting companies like Tesla from selling vehicles directly to consumers [0,2].\n- Tactics used in rent-seeking can result in blocked exchanges by erecting barriers to entry or manipulating regulations. Such barriers prevent new competitors from entering the market, allowing existing players to maintain economic rents without the risk of losing market share [6,8].\n- These tactics often result in inefficiencies; resources are directed towards securing these rents rather than productive activities. This can lead to higher costs for consumers and a reduction in market competition, as resources that could enhance economic output are instead used to sustain these privileges [3,4,5].\n- Rent-seeking can lead to a misallocation of both government and private resources, creating conditions where resources are either wasted or left idle due to the pursuit of policies that benefit rent-seekers without broader economic benefits [4,5].\n- Corruption and regulatory capture can exacerbate rent-seeking behavior, with firms and bureaucrats engaging in mutual support to secure policies that hinder competition under the guise of public interest [2,13].\n- Ultimately, rent-seeking can be detrimental to economic growth, as resources are diverted from productive use, leading to a society where wealth redistribution occurs through force rather than voluntary exchanges, harming overall market efficiency and public welfare [14,15].","probability":0.0843538316}

In less corrupt countries, rent-seekers spend large sums of money lobbying legislators and the public officials to enact favorable policies [1,13]. \nRent-seeking is like creating unfair competition or illegally making wealth. This activity has many detrimental effects, often shouldered by the taxpayers or consumers who have to pay more for the services they receive or goods they buy. It limits competition, which drives prices high. The bottom line is that rent-seeking is a vice that disrupts market efficiencies and creates pricing disadvantages. This has ripple effects that only benefit the rent-seekers themselves. They obtain added economic rents without additional obligations, creating unfair advantages [12]. The practice only lines the pockets of certain individuals with money, giving them more market shares while thwarting competitors [3]. Additionally, rent-seeking is indirectly funded by taxpayers. These revenues do not improve the economic climate or benefit taxpayers [3].\nRent-seeking leads to wastage of private resources because significant amounts are spent on pursuing and competing for rents instead of generating economic gain [4,5]. The resources are diverted from producing goods or offering services to achieving the much-needed policy goals. Rent-seeking weakens any economy since resources are misappropriated or idle [4].

However, such techniques can potentially undermine individual moral agency by subtly manipulating choices, thereby impinging on one's autonomy and moral responsibility. Nudging can create situations where individuals, instead of making choices derived from personal ethical deliberation, are led to decisions influenced by external structures which prioritize certain behaviors over others [12,13,18].\n\nCritics argue that while nudging seems to allow freedom of choice, it actually exercises a form of soft paternalism. By guiding individuals towards decisions deemed beneficial by others, it may diminish the intrinsic moral value individuals place on self-generated decisions. This, in turn, can restrict moral agency by prioritizing outcomes manipulated through choice architecture over personal moral deliberation [0,11].\n\nMoral agency involves the capacity to evaluate choices against internal moral standards and to act based on those evaluations. By framing choices within a constrained architecture that favors certain decisions, nudging may reduce the space for personal moral growth and self-regulation, vital components of moral agency [2,3,10]. Furthermore, nudging's reliance on cognitive heuristics rather than rational deliberation raises ethical concerns about its impact on moral agency, as it may promote behavior that circumvents deeper ethical reasoning [13,15].\n\nIn conclusion, while nudging is intended to promote socially desirable outcomes, its impact on moral agency is contentious.

In other words, a nudge alters the environment so that when heuristic, or System 1, decision-making is used, the resulting choice will be the most positive or desired outcome [13,15]. A classic example is having employees automatically enrolled in a 401 (k) retirement account, rather than asking employees to opt in to such a program [11]. The nudge doesn't stop employees from opting out, and it encourages people to invest in their future, which Sunsteing and Thaler think is in their best interests [11]. Several different techniques exist for nudging, including defaults, social proof heuristics, and increasing the salience of the desired option [15]. \nRichard Thaler and Cass Sunstein suggested that if a particular unfortunate behavioral or decision making pattern is the result of cognitive boundaries, biases, or habits, this pattern may be \u201cnudged\u201d toward a better option by integrating insights about the very same kind of boundaries, biases, and habits into the choice architecture surrounding the behavior \u2013 i.e. the physical, social, and psychological aspects of the contexts that influence and in which our choices take place \u2013 in ways that promote a more preferred behavior rather than obstruct it [12]. In particular, they argue that such nudges may avoid some of the challenges and potential pitfalls of traditional regulation, such as costly procedures and ineffective campaigning, unintended effects of incentivizing behaviors, and invasive choice regulation, such as bans. The advantage, they claim, of applying nudges is that public policy makers might thus supplement \u2013 or, perhaps, even replace \u2013 traditional regulation with nudges to influence people\u2019s everyday choices and behaviors in cheaper, less invasive, and more effective ways [12]. That is, nudging seems to offer policy makers an effective way to influence citizens\u2019 behavior without further restricting freedom of choice, imposing mandatory obligations, or introducing new taxations, or tax reliefs [12]. \nA nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people\u2019s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives [12].","probability":0.0586381754}

However, this approach can potentially diminish moral agency by influencing individuals' autonomy and critical decision-making capabilities. Nudging can undermine an individual's moral autonomy by constructing environments that steer choices towards pre-decided \"better\" options, curtailing the opportunity for self-reflection and moral reasoning about choices that might better align with the person's intrinsic values or interests[9,10,12]. \n\nFurthermore, moral agency depends on one's ability to self-regulate according to personal standards and situational circumstances, amplifying self-worth through actions that align with these standards[2,3]. The process of nudging might bypass or overshadow these self-regulatory mechanisms by manipulating cognitive shortcuts or biases, prompting decisions that align more with societal norms or external judgments than personal ethical frameworks[16,17].\n\nThe imposition of external decision-making frameworks diminishes moral agency by reducing ethical behavior to mere obedience, where individuals may conform to structured choices rather than actively engaging in ethical reasoning[6]. Critics have pointed out that this conformity might revert to a form of moral disengagement, where deeper moral considerations are overlooked in favor of immediate behavioral compliance[3,8].\n\nWhile nudging is intended to improve decision-making efficiency and societal outcomes, it raises ethical questions regarding autonomy and the genuine cultivation of moral agency.

For instance, students coming from the dominant culture, or whose native language aligns with the medium of instruction, may not have to consider these aspects of their identity, allowing them ease of expression and greater participation. Conversely, students from marginalized backgrounds may find their contributions undervalued, affecting their willingness to engage and feel included [0,1]. \n\nThe presence of privilege in classrooms creates an environment where power dynamics shape communication. These dynamics often leave students without privilege struggling to voice their perspectives, subsequently impacting their learning experience and sense of belonging [3,7]. It is critical for educators to recognize these dynamics and cultivate an inclusive atmosphere where all students feel empowered to contribute. Educators can do this by actively facilitating equitable participation, recognizing the diverse identities present, and mitigating the effects of privilege through careful classroom management and inclusive pedagogy [8,16].\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the linkage between privilege and being heard is crucial for fostering an equitable learning environment.

Evolutionary psychology posits that many societal roles have roots in the adaptive functions necessary for survival in prehistoric environments, specifically through the division of labor between the sexes. This perspective argues that gender roles are a result of evolutionary pressures where, for instance, men became hunters due to their physical strength, whereas women, being primarily involved in childbearing and nurturing, were more homebound and caretakers of children [0,1,2]. These roles were seen as adaptive strategies that enhanced survival and reproductive success in the environment of evolutionary adaptation (EEA), shaping psychological differences between men and women [1,3].\n\nWhile evolutionary psychology emphasizes biological determinants of societal roles, contrasting theories, like the social role theory, highlight the significant influence of cultural and social constructs.

Moreover, changes in social conditions can alter societal roles, which suggests that roles are not immutable but responsive to shifting cultural and social dynamics [6,16].\n\nIn conclusion, societal roles are complex and multifaceted, shaped by both evolutionary imperatives and cultural norms.

The division of labor structures psychological sex differences and similarities. By observing the activities of women and men in their society, people form gender role beliefs or sex-typed expectations. For example, given that women perform more childcare than men in most industrialized societies, women are believed to be especially nurturing and caring. Given that men are more likely than women to hold higher-status jobs in industrialized societies, men are believed to be especially dominant and assertive. Gender roles then influence behavior through social and biological processes. In social interaction, people respond more favorably to others who conform to gender role expectations [4].\n\n- Likewise, the evolutionary approach predicts that the biological and anatomical differences between men and women will result in different preferences for partner selection. For example, human biology dictates that women need help and protection during pregnancy and that their fertility is time-limited. Therefore, it makes sense that men who can provide protection will be deemed attractive to women and that young\u2014and hence fertile\u2014women will be attractive to men. Indeed, studies show that when it comes to long-term relationships, women overall emphasize the importance of status parameters, while men find female youth highly attractive. On the other hand, \"social role theory,\" developed by the American psychologist Alice Eagly, argues that social\u2014rather than biological\u2014processes dictate our social choices. According to this argument, the mate selection rules are dictated by the roles that women and men occupy in society. Thus, people's preferences in the search for a mate are expected to shift as social roles and norms shift. For example, women are attracted to men with power and money because society limits their own ability to gain power and money.

The fact that producers are specialized, and thus efficient in their production, ensures lower production costs than if products were made by less-specialized producers, translating into lower prices [0]. It allows producers to increase their profit by lowering production costs, expanding their market, producing a wide range of goods, increasing sales, and reaping the benefits of economies of scale [1,7,8]. Producers benefit from specialization because it leads to economic efficiency. This economic efficiency is derived from economy of scale and from learning process (gaining skills) [2]. Occasionally, people who specialize in a field develop new techniques or new technologies that lead to huge increases in productivity [3]. When workers are trained to perfect one task rather than having to handle a host of tasks, they tend to master the one task quickly and become more efficient [4,5]. More efficient workers are also more productive and produce products of the best quality [5,12].\nSpecialization is important in the operation of a market because everyone wants highest quality products.

In this unregulated sector, valuable materials like metals are extracted from e-waste by burning components such as plastic casings and insulated wires. This process releases a variety of harmful pollutants, including dioxins and furans, which are notorious for their toxicity and persistence in the environment [0, 1, 5, 10].\n\nThese substances are the result of burning materials containing brominated and chlorinated compounds, commonly found in electronics. When these are incinerated, especially in the open and under suboptimal conditions, they generate mixed halogenated dioxins and furans, which are potent toxicants that contribute to atmospheric pollution [1, 9]. The adverse effects extend beyond immediate health concerns. The pollutants can travel long distances through the atmosphere, impacting air quality and potentially affecting areas far removed from the original source of pollution [1, 3].\n\nMoreover, the open burning of e-waste contributes to the generation of fine particulate matter, which poses severe health risks, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, further exacerbating the public health challenges in areas engaged in informal recycling [2, 6]. This situation is magnified in regions like Guiyu, China, a well-known e-waste processing hub, where elevated levels of toxic emissions have been documented [1, 2].\n\nIn conclusion, the informal recycling sector significantly contributes to air pollution through the burning of e-waste, releasing hazardous chemicals that persist in the environment and pose widespread ecological and health threats. Crucially, this underscores the need for regulated recycling practices to mitigate these impacts.","probability":0.1385888237}

Open-air burning is a common method used to extract valuable metals like copper from electronic devices, often in developing countries where regulations are weak or non-existent [1, 2, 6, 7, 11]. This practice releases toxic chemicals such as dioxins and furans, some of the most dangerous substances for human health in the air [1, 17]. The fumes from burning plastics and circuit boards contain heavy metals like lead, cadmium, and mercury, which are known to cause respiratory issues, cancer and neurological damage when inhaled [7, 10, 14].\nBurning e-waste also produces fine particulate matter, which can travel long distances through air currents, affecting not only the immediate area but also regions far from the source [1, 16]. In places like Guiyu, China, this has led to widespread air contamination, exposing millions of people to harmful pollutants [1, 2, 7, 16, 17]. Children, in particular, are vulnerable to lead poisoning from inhalation of these fumes [2, 16]. There are high rates of respiratory ailments among those living near recycling sites [16]. The release of brominated flame retardants from burning plastics adds to the complexity of air pollution, creating carcinogenic compounds that linger in the environment [10].\nThe harmful effects of these emissions extend beyond human health, as they also affect ecosystems [3]. Toxic byproducts like dioxins can persist in the atmosphere and settle on plants and soil, entering the food chain through the soil-crop-food pathway [0, 1, 4 16, 17]. This makes informal recycling not only a public health crisis but also an environmental one, contributing to the global issue of air pollution and long-term ecological damage [3, 10, 12, 13, 18]. The lack of protective measures for workers handling e-waste further exacerbates these risks, as many operate without masks or gloves, unknowingly inhaling toxic fumes [6, 8, 10, 18, 19].","probability":0.151597407}

Prime farmlands are not excessively erodible or saturated with water for a long period of time, and they either do not flood frequently or are protected from flooding [0].\n\n- In the early 1800s, the untamed land had extremely rich and fertile soil, so people decided to use the land for farming and cattle raising. The perfect farmland encouraged more and more people to go west to be farmers and ranchers in the open fields of the west, which in turn increased the number of settlements that happened in western America. In fact, in the year 1862, the federal government issued the Homestead Act, which allowed anyone to own their own chunk of the West [2]. \n\n- Population and settlements are usually concentrated on plains. This is because towns are easily laid out on the approximately flat landform found on plains. The landform could be of great economic importance when traversed by rivers. Such plain landforms traversed by rivers make irrigation of farmlands on plains much easier than on any other land form used in agriculture.

Good-quality farmland provides this, and the conditions that create it often provide other benefits that make it attractive for settlement[9].\n\nThe primary reason that good quality farmland encourages settlement is that it enables agriculture. Reliable access to food, such as is provided by farming, revolutionised human civilisation by allowing people to stay in one place, instead of being constantly on the move searching for food[14]. Thus, the easier the soil is to grow crops in, the more attractive it is as a place to settle[9]. Conversely, poor-quality soil leads to low crop yields, and, as was the case in the American West, may encourage those farming there to look for more fertile pastures[1,2].\n\nAreas with good-quality farmland, such as plains and river valleys, also tend to have other attractive qualities, such as a temperate climate, easily-traversed land, and access to clean water[3,4,7,13]. Places like the Nile River Valley have large, flat areas where farms could easily be set up, that would be watered and fertilised with silt by floods every summer[7]. Not only did these convenient features allowed for reliable production of crops such as wheat and barley, they also provided a vital source of clean water and attracted wild animals that could be hunted for meat[8,13]. Rivers can also be an easy means of transport, allowing the development of trade links[13].\n\nIn conclusion, farmland of good quality encourages settlement due not only to the importance of agriculture, but because the conditions that create good quality farmland provide other benefits to a potential human settlement as well[7].","probability":0.0753981874}

The fertility of such land, marked by rich soil, adequate moisture from precipitation or irrigation, and favorable temperature conditions, makes it ideal for agriculture. This capacity to support high-yield crops can sustain large populations and foster community stability, prompting people to settle in these areas [0, 9]. \n\nMoreover, areas with fertile soil often coincide with temperate climatic conditions that avoid extreme weather, further encouraging settlement. Such climates are more conducive to manageable vegetation and farming practices, enhancing the land's overall attractiveness for habitation [4, 10]. \n\nThe strategic location of fertile farmland also plays a crucial role in encouraging settlement. Many significant urban centers were established in these agriculturally rich areas, thus providing a pathway for growth and prosperity as the availability of agricultural products could support urban populations [0]. Additionally, accessible water sources accompanying good farmland facilitate irrigation, another essential factor in sustaining agriculture and attracting settlers [13, 12].\n\nLastly, infrastructure development, notably the building of transport networks such as railroads, has historically followed the establishment of agricultural communities, subsequently encouraging further settlement by offering access to resources and markets [6, 1]. Consequently, the combination of fertile land with favorable environmental and infrastructural factors has continually driven human settlement to areas of prime agricultural quality.","probability":0.0743784098}

Most often good farming land is found on flat plains and with few or no rocks in the soil which also makes it favourable for building on [0,3,5,7,9]. Prime farmland is also most likely located in areas that are not prone to dangerous flooding or erosion [0,3,5,9]. All of these traits will make prime farmland attractive for settlement.\n\nGood-quality farmland also encourages settlement in its appeal to those interested in living on the land while using it for farming. One of the best examples of this is the massive move westward made by farmers after the Homestead Act was passed by the United States Congress in 1862 [1,2,6]. Large numbers of people took up the offer of owning land with the sole requirement being to live on and farm it for five years (and pay a small fee for the land title) [1,2,6].

But, this cannot be true, if there is no joy in it then there is no good in it [1]. There will always be books that bore the reader and they cannot finish them, however, the reader always learns things from such poorly written and edited books, even not enjoying them [9]. No, one picks a novel or a book knowing beforehand that it is not the good one. It is only after reading a little bit that a reader learns about the quality of content, story, plot and writing style [10]. But, what makes bad writing? It is the mindset of not learning the mistakes a writer makes, according to the Guardian [11]. A bad read means the writer was very confused about the subject he was writing, he mixed the plot, the characters, roles, the storyline and then the sentences and structure of the paragraphs. It can also mean that the book was organized poorly or not edited perfectly by a professional editor [6]. That is why professional writers have beta readers who help them improve the content of the book [6]. Many readers read bad books because of good plots and engaging stories, even if the prose is weak, it still keeps the reader hooked [9]. However, sometimes the writer hires a cover designer and editor who make the book appealing and the editor makes the starter a hook that attaches the reader to it so the reader keeps reading [7]. Sometimes readers keep reading the book because of escapism and entertainment rather than literary sophistication [11]. Another factor is Genre appeal and relatability for the reader who picks a book and after reading a few pages, he keeps reading because either the genre appeals to him or is relatable. [12]. In today's era, most of the bad books get viral on social media by bad readers who don't know about the book quality and hype is created hence the good readers tend to check it out of curiosity and end up reading a bad book [19]. There can be so many more reasons as many as reader types that why readers pick a bad book and keep going on. Such book doens last in literature and eventually fades away in history.

One significant reason is educational: reading poorly crafted prose can illuminate what to avoid in writing, offering lessons that can sometimes be more impactful than those derived from well-written texts. As Stephen King suggests, encountering bad writing can be akin to attending a semester at a writing school, as it effectively teaches what not to do [0, 1]. This experiential learning helps budding writers refine their craft by identifying common pitfalls in language, structure, and storytelling. \n\nMoreover, the narrative or characters in a poorly written book may still resonate strongly with readers. Some narratives captivate audiences despite their lack of stylistic finesse because they tell compelling stories or connect on an emotional level [2, 3]. A book might possess a rich storyline or a relatable theme that compensates for its technical deficiencies, leading readers to overlook poor grammar or sentence construction [4].\n\nAdditionally, some readers are motivated by curiosity or the challenge of finishing a book once started, finding intellectual or emotional reward in the process. The endeavor can be seen as an exercise in critical reading, prompting readers to analyze and critique elements that succeed or fail within a text [9, 10].\n\nIn conclusion, while the literary quality of a book significantly impacts its reception, poorly written books can attract readers who seek educational value, engaging narratives, or enjoy the challenge of critical analysis.

This issue of carrying a handgun is not just limited to the US but it has to be tackled globally [2]. Handguns should be regulated at the national level and equally from state to state [3]. Another reason to ban guns is that most violent crimes are committed with guns, thus, restricting gun ownership will likely reduce the number of such crimes.

Gun-related violence claims numerous lives annually, with incidents such as the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting highlighting the tragic potential of firearms in the wrong hands [0,9]. The presence of guns is a significant contributor to the high rates of violent crime and accidental deaths, which could be mitigated through stringent gun control measures.\n\nStatistics reveal that regions with strict gun control laws tend to have lower incidences of gun violence compared to those with lax regulations [1,19]. The rationale is that with fewer guns in circulation, it becomes more challenging for criminals to access firearms, potentially reducing violent crimes and accidental shootings, particularly involving children and adolescents [13]. Additionally, the ease of accessing guns has been shown to escalate impulsive crimes such as suicides and crimes of passion, suggesting that reducing gun availability could lower such incidents [4].\n\nOpponents of gun possession argue that gun ownership is not a necessity for civilian defense, as instances of guns being used successfully for protection without firing a shot are rare [6,7]. Furthermore, the widespread availability of firearms contrasts sharply with the intent of the Second Amendment, which was originally focused on a well-regulated militia rather than individual gun ownership [4].\n\nIn conclusion, the reduction or elimination of guns on the streets could significantly diminish the prevalence of gun-related violence and casualities. By addressing the root causes of gun violence, society can foster a safer environment and reduce the tragic losses often attributed to firearms [18].","probability":0.1078563398}

Proponents argue that a ban could significantly decrease the high incidence of gun violence, which remains alarmingly prevalent in areas like the United States. Notably, mass shootings, such as the tragic Sandy Hook Elementary School incident, highlight the devastating impact of firearms in civilian settings, fueling discussions on tighter gun control measures[0,4]. \n\nStatistical data from various regions suggest that areas with strict gun control laws often experience lower rates of violent crimes. For instance, cities like Washington D.C. have been cited for having reduced murder rates attributed to stringent gun regulations[1]. Furthermore, the presence of guns has been associated with an increased likelihood of suicides and crimes of passion, often resulting in impulsive fatalities that may not occur if firearms were less accessible[4].\n\nThe public health perspective corroborates these claims, noting that reducing the prevalence of firearms would align with strategies to mitigate other societal risks, just as safety regulations have been implemented in industries such as automotive and construction[3]. Advocates stress that stricter gun laws could also lead to fewer accidental shootings and reduce the risk of firearms being accessed by children and teenagers, thereby averting tragedies like the Columbine massacre[13].\n\nWhile the constitutional right to bear arms is often cited as a counterargument, supporters of a ban argue that the Second Amendment was aimed at regulating a well-organized militia rather than enabling widespread individual ownership[4].

They implemented broad economic reforms, supported the arts, and developed trade, leading to flourishing city-states under their regimes [10, 14]. They also employed a form of populism, rallying the support of the disillusioned masses who found themselves disenfranchised by oligarchic or aristocratic dominance [5, 10, 11].\n\nHowever, while some tyrants were markedly beneficial in their initial rule, over time many succumbed to the temptations of absolute power, fostering fear and discontent that ultimately led to their downfall. Tyranny\u2019s downfall often led to the rise of alternative governance forms, such as democracy in Athens, further depicting the transient nature of their rule when lacking broader institutional support [4, 9].

Others enacted laws canceling the debts that poor people owed to the wealthy [2]. Tyrants played an important role in the development of rule by the people, helping to overthrow the oligarchy [2]. They also showed that if common people united behind a leader, they could gain the power to make changes [2].\nEven though some tyrants used their power for good, there were always more cruel and harsh tyrants than good ones [3,4]. These tyrants viewed themselves as heroes, similar to those in the Iliad, who were shaping their polis for the better [0,1].

These actions demonstrated to the populace that tyrants could offer tangible improvements over traditional aristocratic governance, fostering their initial popularity.\n\nHowever, the acceptance of tyrants eventually waned as some began to mirror the authoritarian traits associated with modern tyranny.

These periods emphasized rationalism, mechanization, and the depersonalization of society, leading individuals to feel disconnected not only from each other but also from nature and their own emotions. Romanticists viewed the world through a lens that emphasized the importance of subjective experience, spontaneity, and emotional depth, thus offering a remedy to the widespread alienation experienced during their time.\n\nRomanticism was fundamentally a reaction against the mechanistic worldview propagated by the Enlightenment, which proposed that man and nature were like machines operating under rational principles. This perspective was seen as alienating because it reduced individuals to mere cogs in a societal machine, devoid of personal meaning or connection to the natural world[1,2,3]. Romanticists, therefore, sought to re-establish an intimate relationship with nature, which they did not view as a mere resource to be exploited, but as an organic, living organism to be experienced emotionally[0,2].\n\nThe Romantic Movement also emerged as a critique of industrialization, which transformed landscapes, and labor into impersonal and commodified experiences.

In response, Romanticists advocated a return to nature and a simpler way of life, celebrating the primitive and the pure as moral and spiritual anchors in a rapidly changing world[7,17].\n\nIn conclusion, alienation was a significant theme in Romanticism as it encapsulated the discontent towards the rational and mechanical ethos of the Enlightenment and industrialization.

Authentic existence comes from unleashing emotions and cultivating the subjective and irrational dimension of life. The attempts to resolve the dilemma of alienation, understandable as they are, would find concrete and political expression in fascism [1].\n\n- Romanticism became the antidote to alienation. It asserted the value of the natural world in that it was seen not as a machine but as a living organism. Nature must not be approached with reason and intellect but by experience, emotions, and irrationalism, as opposed to rationalism. The immanence of God (or gods) was emphasized, while transcendence was denied. Romanticism was also characterized by nostalgia for the past and an admiration for the primitive. It was believed that primitive cultures were morally superior because they were more in tune with the natural world [0].\n\n- People and nature were objectified, and reduced to commodity status. This was regarded as undesirable and leading to the degradation of the humans.

The phenomenon of alienation developed as a consequence of the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution, which were characterized by increased urbanization and mechanization. These changes led individuals to feel isolated, both from their communities and from nature, fostering a sense of existential solitude and disconnection from personal identity [1,3]. \n\nRomanticism sought to counteract this alienation by emphasizing emotional expression, individualism, and a return to the natural world. It cast nature not as a machine, but as a living organism to be valued for its inherent beauty and spiritual significance. This perspective represented a shift from the rationalist and mechanistic outlook of the Enlightenment to one that prioritized subjective experience over objective knowledge [0,1]. \n\nThe movement viewed the natural world as a source of spiritual renewal and liberation, offering a respite from the perceived moral decline and dehumanization of industrial society [2,19]. Romantic artists championed the individual's imagination as a means to explore the self and initiate a personal connection with nature, thereby navigating away from the social alienation that industrial life engendered [19]. Prominent figures within the movement, such as the poet William Wordsworth, drew inspiration from medievalism, mythology, and the sublime aspects of nature to express the profound awe and terror that these elements inspired, further accentuating the era's emotional intensity [15,17]. \n\nOverall, alienation was not just a problem romantics aimed to solve; it was also a theme through which they articulated a vision for a re-enchanted world, where individuals could reclaim their connection to nature and reinvigorate their spiritual and emotional lives [5].","probability":0.0898761463}

However, regional experts argued that the Taliban\u2019s strict Islamic rule essentially wiped out opium production. Following the U.S. invasion in late 2001 and the overthrow of the Taliban regime, production of Afghan opium rose steadily. Leaders of drug cartels have been retroactively defined by the DEA as having been narco-terrorists. For example, Escobar of the Medell\u00edn cartel is now described as having committed \u201c terrorist activities,\u201d such as the bombing of a commercial airliner in 1989 [1].","probability":0.2061156456}

These groups, previously identified as communist, turned to drug trafficking as a primary source of income [2].\n- The Medell\u00edn and Cali cartels in Colombia capitalized on the rising demand for cocaine in the United States during the 1980s, resulting in their substantial growth and dominance in the global drug trade. This was further facilitated by U.S. efforts to curb the Caribbean drug smuggling routes, redirecting traffic through Mexico [7].\n- Mexican cartels, originally couriers for Colombian cartels, began to dominate the drug trafficking routes into the United States post-Cold War as Colombian cartels weakened. This resulted in the consolidation of Mexican cartels and increased violence as they solidified control over key routes [11, 15].\n- The \"War on Drugs\" was utilized by US administrations, particularly under Reagan, as a strategic tool to influence foreign and domestic policies. It was also an approach to control geopolitical interests in Latin America following the geopolitical realignments after the Cold War [13].\n- Additionally, the political instability in Mexico, compounded by internal corruption and the existing ties between political elements, such as the PRI, and drug traffickers, allowed drug cartels to thrive and expand their influence significantly in the post-Cold War period [16].","probability":0.0944407688}

As the trade grew, a diverse group of entrepreneurs became involved, ranging from well-respected individuals with backgrounds in ranching and horsing to petty criminals. The growing demand for cocaine soon prompted the expansion of the trade beyond small amounts tucked into suitcases. The cartel purchased private planes to carry its shipments and constructed more sophisticated drug laboratories. They even purchased a small island in the Caribbean to refuel their aircraft [4]. \n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, the drug scene in Mexico accelerated. Before the 1980s, most of Mexico's drug production yielded marijuana and small bits of heroin. Cocaine mostly reached the U.S.A. through the Bahamas and the Caribbean. After the U.S.A. shut down the routes that entered the state from Florida, Colombian drug cartels established a partnership with Mexican traffickers and cartels, finding new routes for smuggling cocaine over land into North America [16]. Unfortunately, hundreds of government officials, judges and policemen who failed to accept bribes were assassinated under the orders of the barons [14].\n\nIn addition, there are many more shocking facts and concerns that made drug cartels a big thing post-Cold War.","probability":0.170135733}

During the Cold War, the United States' foreign policy centered around combating communism, often supporting military governments that were also involved in drug trafficking, thus laying the groundwork for powerful drug networks [0]. As the Cold War concluded, the \"War on Drugs\" became a major focus for the U.S., serving as a new pretext for military and counter-insurgency operations, and inadvertently supporting right-wing regimes linked with the drug trade [0].\n\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union led many Marxist organizations involved in drug trafficking to be redefined under the \"narco-terrorism\" label. This was further compounded by the UN Security Council's acknowledgment of the links between terrorism, drug trafficking, and transnational organized crime [1,2]. The collapse of regimes that once supported these groups allowed drug cartels to gain significant power. Colombian cartels such as Medell\u00edn and Cali had already established substantial drug networks by the 1980s, trading vast quantities of narcotics and accruing immense wealth that translated into political influence [3,6].\n\nParallelly, Mexican cartels transitioned from being couriers to major distributors, leveraging old routes left by Caribbean networks dismantled by U.S. efforts, thus increasing their dominance in the drug market during and after the Cold War [16,17]. These cartels capitalized on corruption, utilizing profits to influence local governments and sustain their operations [15].\n\nIn conclusion, the decline of the Soviet Influence, coupled with U.S. foreign policy shifts and aggressive drug enforcement strategies, inadvertently propelled drug cartels into more significant operational roles. They remain critical players in both the illicit economy and broader geopolitical contexts.","probability":0.0659683869}

The conclusion of the Cold War saw a strategic shift in the U.S. as it transitioned its focus from combating communism to orchestrating the \"War on Drugs\" [0]. This shift provided a new banner under which U.S. foreign interventions continued. Central to this campaign were efforts aimed at curbing the extensive networks of drug cartels emerging in Latin America, significantly affecting Colombia and Mexico [3,6].\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s marked the expansion and consolidation of powerful drug cartels, notably the Medell\u00edn Cartel in Colombia and the Guadalajara Cartel in Mexico [4,7]. These cartels benefited from established trafficking routes and burgeoning demand for narcotics in the United States. The Medell\u00edn Cartel, led by notable figures such as Pablo Escobar, played a critical role in controlling cocaine routes to the United States, contributing to the cartel\u2019s extensive wealth and power [9,14]. Concurrently, the dismantling of cocaine routes via Florida in the U.S. led Colombian cartels to partner with Mexican traffickers, solidifying Mexico's role as a primary drug corridor [8].\n\nFurthermore, the concept of \"narco-terrorism\" emerged as these organizations used drug trade proceeds to fund politically motivated violence, blurring lines between drug trafficking and terrorism [1,2]. U.S. counter-narcotics efforts inadequately addressed the root causes, evidenced by persistent high demand and escalating violence linked to cartel operations [11,15]. This period, thus, established drug cartels not only as significant criminal enterprises but also as influential transnational threats that impacted geopolitical and economic landscapes globally.","probability":0.0886626732}
